00:00:28.403 --> 00:00:32.374
The Tesseract has awakened.

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:38.039
It is on a little world, a human world.

00:00:38.705 --> 00:00:42.130
They would wield its power,

00:00:42.417 --> 00:00:48.140
but our ally knows its
workings as they never will.

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:52.762
He is ready to lead

00:00:52.928 --> 00:00:58.401
and our force, our Chitauri, will follow.

00:00:59.977 --> 00:01:02.446
A world will be his.

00:01:02.604 --> 00:01:05.733
The universe, yours.

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:11.531
And the humans,
what can they do but burn?

Use the free code JOINNOW at
www.playships.eu

00:01:26.003 --> 00:01:27.175
All personnel,

00:01:27.254 --> 00:01:29.598
the evacuation order
has been confirmed.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.000
Proceed to your designated vehicles
immediately for force evacuation

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:35.500
This is not a drill

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Emergency personnel

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.499
Proceed to your designated vehicles
for on site evacuation

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:03.002
How bad is it?

00:02:03.165 --> 00:02:06.294
That's the problem, sir. We don't know.

00:02:10.047 --> 00:02:12.971
Dr. Selvig read an energy surge
from the Tesseract four hours ago.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:14.973
NASA didn't authorize Selvig
to go to test phase.

00:02:15.135 --> 00:02:17.388
He wasn't testing it.
He wasn't even in the room.

00:02:17.554 --> 00:02:18.555
Spontaneous event.

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:19.640
It just turned itself on?

00:02:20.057 --> 00:02:21.149
Where are the energy levels now?

00:02:21.308 --> 00:02:23.527
Climbing. When Selvig couldn't
shut it down, we ordered evac.

00:02:23.685 --> 00:02:24.732
How long to get everyone out?

00:02:25.103 --> 00:02:26.480
Campus should be clear
in the next half-hour.

00:02:26.647 --> 00:02:27.944
Do better.

00:02:28.857 --> 00:02:30.859
Sir, evacuation may be futile.

00:02:31.026 --> 00:02:32.278
We should tell them
to go back to sleep?

00:02:32.611 --> 00:02:34.864
If we can't control
the Tesseract's energy,

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:37.408
there may not be
a minimum safe distance.

00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:38.583
I need you to make sure

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:40.377
the Phase 2 prototypes
are shipped out.

00:02:40.494 --> 00:02:42.588
Sir, is that really a priority right now?

00:02:42.746 --> 00:02:44.498
Until such time as the world ends,

00:02:44.581 --> 00:02:46.458
we will act as though
it intends to spin on.

00:02:47.584 --> 00:02:49.006
Clear out the tech below.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.263
Every piece of Phase 2
on a truck and gone.

00:02:51.421 --> 00:02:52.843
Yes, sir.

00:02:53.256 --> 00:02:54.428
With me.

00:02:57.427 --> 00:02:58.428
Talk to me, Doctor.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:01.852
Director.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:03.733
Is there anything we know for certain?

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:06.145
The Tesseract is misbehaving.

00:03:06.311 --> 00:03:09.155
- Is that supposed to be funny?
- No, it's not funny at all.

00:03:09.314 --> 00:03:12.659
The Tesseract is not only
active, she's behaving.

00:03:13.068 --> 00:03:14.115
I assume you pulled the plug.

00:03:14.277 --> 00:03:15.995
She's an energy source.

00:03:16.321 --> 00:03:19.370
We turn off the power,
she turns it back on.

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:20.575
If she reaches peak level...

00:03:20.742 --> 00:03:24.212
We prepared for this, Doctor.
Harnessing energy from space.

00:03:24.371 --> 00:03:25.793
But we don't have the harness.

00:03:25.872 --> 00:03:26.964
My calculations are far from complete.

00:03:27.708 --> 00:03:30.302
And she's throwing off
interference, radiation.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:31.928
Nothing harmful,
low levels of gamma radiation.

00:03:33.088 --> 00:03:34.681
That can be harmful.

00:03:35.132 --> 00:03:36.600
Where's Agent Barton?

00:03:36.675 --> 00:03:38.473
The Hawk?

00:03:39.302 --> 00:03:40.975
Up in his nest, as usual.

00:03:42.806 --> 00:03:44.649
Agent Barton, report.

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:46.692
I gave you this detail

00:03:46.768 --> 00:03:48.361
so you could keep
a close eye on things.

00:03:48.562 --> 00:03:49.984
Well, I see better from a distance.

00:03:50.147 --> 00:03:51.865
Have you seen anything
that might set this thing off?

00:03:52.524 --> 00:03:54.743
Doctor, it's spiking again.

00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.323
No one's come or gone.

00:03:56.486 --> 00:03:58.159
And Selvig's clean.

00:03:58.321 --> 00:04:00.494
No contacts, no IMs.

00:04:01.116 --> 00:04:02.709
If there was any tampering,
sir, it wasn't at this end.

00:04:04.828 --> 00:04:06.205
"At this end"?

00:04:06.371 --> 00:04:10.296
Yeah, the Cube is a doorway to
the other end of space, right?

00:04:12.043 --> 00:04:13.295
Doors open from both sides.

00:04:14.129 --> 00:04:15.506
Not yet.

00:05:23.406 --> 00:05:26.455
Sir, please put down the spear.

00:06:05.782 --> 00:06:06.829
You have heart.

00:06:37.647 --> 00:06:39.149
Please don't.

00:06:40.817 --> 00:06:41.909
I still need that.

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:43.821
This doesn't have to get any messier.

00:06:43.987 --> 00:06:45.079
Of course it does.

00:06:45.322 --> 00:06:47.040
I've come too far for anything else.

00:06:48.992 --> 00:06:51.836
I am Loki, of Asgard

00:06:52.787 --> 00:06:55.165
and I am burdened with
glorious purpose.

00:06:55.332 --> 00:06:56.834
Loki.

00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:58.627
Brother of Thor.

00:06:58.793 --> 00:07:00.966
We have no quarrel with your people.

00:07:01.463 --> 00:07:04.137
An ant has no quarrel with a boot.

00:07:05.008 --> 00:07:06.510
Are you planning to step on us?

00:07:07.010 --> 00:07:10.105
I come with glad tidings

00:07:11.348 --> 00:07:13.021
of a world made free.

00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:14.608
Free from what?

00:07:14.768 --> 00:07:15.940
Freedom.

00:07:16.686 --> 00:07:19.064
Freedom is life's great lie.

00:07:19.522 --> 00:07:22.776
Once you accept that, in your heart,

00:07:27.364 --> 00:07:29.082
you will know peace.

00:07:29.616 --> 00:07:32.119
Yeah, you say "peace,"

00:07:32.285 --> 00:07:34.208
I kind of think you mean the other thing.

00:07:34.371 --> 00:07:36.874
Sir, Director Fury is stalling.

00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:38.462
This place is about to blow

00:07:38.541 --> 00:07:39.963
and drop a hundred feet of rock on us.

00:07:41.628 --> 00:07:42.720
He means to bury us.

00:07:42.879 --> 00:07:44.051
Like the pharaohs of old.

00:07:44.255 --> 00:07:46.303
He's right. The portal
is collapsing in on itself.

00:07:46.466 --> 00:07:48.560
We've got maybe two minutes
before this goes critical.

00:07:48.885 --> 00:07:49.886
Well, then.

00:08:05.652 --> 00:08:06.744
I need these vehicles.

00:08:10.865 --> 00:08:12.913
- Who's that?
- They didn't tell me.

00:08:16.204 --> 00:08:17.501
Hill!

00:08:17.747 --> 00:08:18.623
Do you copy?

00:08:20.083 --> 00:08:21.130
Barton has turned.

00:08:34.097 --> 00:08:36.941
They have the Tesseract!
Shut them down!

00:09:13.636 --> 00:09:15.684
Okay, let's go. No, leave it. Go!

00:09:32.322 --> 00:09:34.199
We're clear upstairs, sir.
You need to go.

00:11:06.291 --> 00:11:07.668
Director?

00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:09.427
Director Fury, do you copy?

00:11:09.752 --> 00:11:12.096
The Tesseract is with a hostile force.

00:11:12.255 --> 00:11:14.428
I have men down. Hill?

00:11:15.091 --> 00:11:17.014
A lot of men still under.

00:11:17.177 --> 00:11:18.929
I don't know how many survivors.

00:11:19.095 --> 00:11:20.312
Sound a general call.

00:11:20.471 --> 00:11:22.018
I want every living soul
not working rescue

00:11:22.098 --> 00:11:23.099
looking for that briefcase.

00:11:23.183 --> 00:11:24.275
Roger that.

00:11:24.434 --> 00:11:27.813
Coulson, get back to base.
This is a Level Seven.

00:11:29.105 --> 00:11:30.698
As of right now,

00:11:30.815 --> 00:11:32.158
we are at war.

00:11:34.110 --> 00:11:35.453
What do we do?

00:12:12.273 --> 00:12:15.777
This is not how I wanted this evening
to go.

00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.658
I know how you wanted this evening
to go.

00:12:17.737 --> 00:12:18.863
Believe me

00:12:18.947 --> 00:12:19.994
this is better.

00:12:21.157 --> 00:12:22.875
Who are you working for?

00:12:23.409 --> 00:12:24.831
Lermentov, yes?

00:12:26.955 --> 00:12:28.457
Does he think

00:12:28.665 --> 00:12:30.338
we have to go through him

00:12:30.833 --> 00:12:32.335
to move our cargo?

00:12:33.836 --> 00:12:38.387
I thought General Solohob
is in charge of the export business.

00:12:38.758 --> 00:12:40.760
Solohob

00:12:40.885 --> 00:12:43.013
a bagman, a front.

00:12:45.390 --> 00:12:49.645
Your outdated information betrays you.

00:12:51.187 --> 00:12:53.815
The famous Black Widow

00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:59.821
and she turns out to be
simply another pretty face.

00:13:00.822 --> 00:13:03.871
You really think I'm pretty?

00:13:06.536 --> 00:13:08.834
Tell Lermentov we don't need him

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:12.710
to move the tanks.

00:13:13.626 --> 00:13:16.300
Tell him he is out.

00:13:16.671 --> 00:13:18.344
Well...

00:13:21.175 --> 00:13:22.802
...you may have to write it down.

00:13:31.894 --> 00:13:33.396
It's for her.

00:13:36.816 --> 00:13:38.159
You listen carefully

00:13:38.234 --> 00:13:40.532
You're at 1-14
Silensky Plaza, 3rd floor.

00:13:41.070 --> 00:13:43.038
We have an F-22
exactly eight miles out.

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:45.992
Put the woman on the phone
or I will blow up the block

00:13:46.075 --> 00:13:48.169
before you can make the lobby.

00:13:54.751 --> 00:13:56.924
- We need you to come in.
- Are you kidding'? I'm working.

00:13:57.086 --> 00:13:58.258
This takes precedence.

00:13:58.588 --> 00:14:00.261
I'm in the middle of an interrogation.

00:14:00.381 --> 00:14:02.008
This moron is giving me everything.

00:14:02.592 --> 00:14:05.061
I don't give everything.

00:14:06.637 --> 00:14:07.889
Look, you can't pull me
out of this right now.

00:14:07.972 --> 00:14:08.973
Natasha...

00:14:10.725 --> 00:14:12.068
Barton's been compromised.

00:14:15.438 --> 00:14:17.315
Let me put you on hold.

00:14:59.023 --> 00:15:00.024
Where is Barton now?

00:15:00.191 --> 00:15:01.488
- We don't know.
- But he's alive?

00:15:01.901 --> 00:15:04.529
We think so. I'll brief you on
everything when you get back.

00:15:04.904 --> 00:15:06.998
But first, we need you to
talk to the big guy.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:10.334
Coulson, you know that Stark trusts me
about as far as he can throw me.

00:15:10.493 --> 00:15:13.667
I've got Stark. You get the big guy.

00:15:38.688 --> 00:15:39.689
Who are you?

00:15:40.189 --> 00:15:41.315
Get out!

00:15:41.399 --> 00:15:43.948
There is sickness here!

00:15:44.026 --> 00:15:45.027
You're a doctor.

00:15:46.737 --> 00:15:48.080
My father's not waking up!

00:15:48.156 --> 00:15:49.783
He has a fever and he's moaning

00:15:49.866 --> 00:15:51.038
but his eyes won't open.

00:15:51.117 --> 00:15:52.118
Slow down.

00:15:53.536 --> 00:15:54.662
My father...

00:15:57.331 --> 00:15:58.332
Like them?

00:16:02.336 --> 00:16:03.633
Please.

00:16:30.781 --> 00:16:33.125
You should've got paid
up front, Banner.

00:16:33.284 --> 00:16:34.627
You know, for a man

00:16:34.702 --> 00:16:35.999
who's supposed to be avoiding stress

00:16:36.204 --> 00:16:39.253
you picked a hell of a place to settle.

00:16:41.209 --> 00:16:43.337
Avoiding stress isn't the secret.

00:16:43.628 --> 00:16:45.756
Then what is it? Yoga?

00:16:47.298 --> 00:16:50.518
You brought me to the edge of
the city. Smart.

00:16:51.052 --> 00:16:55.148
I assume the whole place
is surrounded.

00:16:55.556 --> 00:16:56.978
Just you and me.

00:16:58.184 --> 00:17:00.278
And your actress buddy?

00:17:00.436 --> 00:17:02.188
Is she a spy, too?
They start that young?

00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:04.110
I did.

00:17:04.273 --> 00:17:05.365
Who are you?

00:17:05.441 --> 00:17:06.442
Natasha Romanoff.

00:17:09.987 --> 00:17:11.364
Are you here to kill me, Ms. Romanoff?

00:17:11.531 --> 00:17:14.125
Because that's not going to
work out for everyone.

00:17:14.450 --> 00:17:16.623
No, of course not. I'm here
on behalf of S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:17:18.663 --> 00:17:20.040
S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:17:21.958 --> 00:17:22.959
How did they find me?

00:17:23.125 --> 00:17:24.547
We never lost you, Doctor.

00:17:24.794 --> 00:17:26.091
We've kept our distance.

00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:27.888
Even helped keep some other
interested parties

00:17:27.964 --> 00:17:29.090
off your scent.

00:17:29.674 --> 00:17:30.721
Why?

00:17:30.800 --> 00:17:33.223
Nick Fury seems to trust you.

00:17:33.386 --> 00:17:34.729
But now we need you to come in.

00:17:35.972 --> 00:17:37.599
What if I say no?

00:17:38.057 --> 00:17:40.025
I'll persuade you.

00:17:42.311 --> 00:17:46.691
And what if the other guy says no?

00:17:47.358 --> 00:17:49.031
You've been more than a year
without an incident.

00:17:49.193 --> 00:17:51.491
I don't think you want to
break that streak.

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:56.664
Well, I don't every time get what I want.

00:17:57.660 --> 00:17:59.628
Doctor, we're facing a potential
global catastrophe.

00:18:00.705 --> 00:18:03.584
Well, those I actively try to avoid.

00:18:04.166 --> 00:18:06.260
This

00:18:06.419 --> 00:18:08.547
is the Tesseract.

00:18:08.671 --> 00:18:11.515
It has the potential energy
to wipe out the planet.

00:18:14.635 --> 00:18:16.512
What does Fury want me to do,
swallow it?

00:18:17.013 --> 00:18:19.266
He wants you to find it. It's been taken.

00:18:20.308 --> 00:18:24.529
It emits a gamma signature
that's too weak for us to trace.

00:18:24.687 --> 00:18:27.657
There's no one that knows
gamma radiation like you do.

00:18:27.815 --> 00:18:30.318
If there was, that's where I'd be.

00:18:31.193 --> 00:18:33.161
So, Fury isn't after the monster?

00:18:33.571 --> 00:18:34.868
Not that he's told me.

00:18:35.031 --> 00:18:37.250
And he tells you everything?

00:18:37.867 --> 00:18:39.494
Talk to Fury. He needs you on this.

00:18:39.577 --> 00:18:40.749
He needs me in a cage?

00:18:40.828 --> 00:18:41.795
No one's going to put you in a...

00:18:41.871 --> 00:18:42.713
Stop lying to me!

00:18:46.917 --> 00:18:49.591
I'm sorry. That was mean.

00:18:50.504 --> 00:18:52.723
I just wanted to see what you'd do.

00:18:53.883 --> 00:18:56.887
Why don't we do this the easy way

00:18:57.053 --> 00:18:58.350
where you don't use that

00:18:58.512 --> 00:19:02.233
and the other guy
doesn't make a mess.

00:19:03.225 --> 00:19:04.568
Okay?

00:19:05.519 --> 00:19:06.896
Natasha?

00:19:12.526 --> 00:19:13.618
Stand down.

00:19:14.528 --> 00:19:16.121
We're good here.

00:19:17.907 --> 00:19:19.250
"Just you and me."

00:19:21.619 --> 00:19:24.247
This is out of line, Director.

00:19:24.413 --> 00:19:26.882
You're dealing
with forces you can't control.

00:19:27.249 --> 00:19:30.753
You ever been in a war,
Councilman? In a firefight?

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:33.764
Did you feel
an overabundance of control?

00:19:33.923 --> 00:19:37.348
You're saying that this Asgard
is declaring war on our planet?

00:19:37.426 --> 00:19:40.100
Not Asgard. Loki.

00:19:40.262 --> 00:19:43.106
He can't be working alone.
What about the other one?

00:19:43.182 --> 00:19:44.274
His brother.

00:19:44.350 --> 00:19:46.318
Our intelligence says
Thor is not a hostile

00:19:46.602 --> 00:19:47.603
but he's worlds away.

00:19:47.770 --> 00:19:49.613
We can't depend on him to help, either.

00:19:49.689 --> 00:19:50.690
It's up to us.

00:19:50.773 --> 00:19:53.447
Which is why you
should be focusing on Phase 2.

00:19:53.609 --> 00:19:54.781
It was designed for exactly this...

00:19:55.111 --> 00:19:57.955
Phase 2 isn't ready. Our enemy is.

00:19:58.531 --> 00:20:00.124
We need a response team.

00:20:00.282 --> 00:20:02.455
The Avengers Initiative was shut down.

00:20:02.618 --> 00:20:04.461
This isn't about the Avengers.

00:20:04.787 --> 00:20:05.959
We've seen the list.

00:20:06.122 --> 00:20:08.375
You're running the world's greatest
covert security network

00:20:08.457 --> 00:20:10.130
and you're going to leave
the fate of the human race

00:20:10.251 --> 00:20:11.548
to a handful of freaks.

00:20:11.627 --> 00:20:13.595
I'm not leaving anything to anyone.

00:20:13.754 --> 00:20:15.677
We need a response team.

00:20:16.215 --> 00:20:18.968
These people may be isolated,
unbalanced even

00:20:19.135 --> 00:20:23.231
but I believe with the right push
they can be exactly what we need.

00:20:23.597 --> 00:20:24.974
You believe?

00:20:25.141 --> 00:20:28.486
War isn't won by sentiment, Director.

00:20:29.395 --> 00:20:32.820
No, it's won by soldiers.

00:20:52.376 --> 00:20:53.798
There's not enough time.

00:20:54.128 --> 00:20:55.675
I got to put her in the water!

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:02.018
You won't be alone.

00:21:02.678 --> 00:21:04.021
Oh, my God.

00:21:04.638 --> 00:21:05.855
This guy is still alive!

00:21:30.831 --> 00:21:32.629
Trouble sleeping?

00:21:33.918 --> 00:21:36.387
I slept for 70 years, sir.
I think I've had my fill.

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:41.805
Then you should be out,
celebrating, seeing the world.

00:21:47.890 --> 00:21:50.769
When I went under,
the world was at war.

00:21:50.935 --> 00:21:52.482
I wake up, they say we won.

00:21:53.479 --> 00:21:54.731
They didn't say what we lost.

00:21:55.606 --> 00:21:57.700
We've made some mistakes
along the way.

00:21:58.359 --> 00:21:59.736
Some, very recently.

00:22:01.570 --> 00:22:02.822
Are you here with a mission, sir?

00:22:02.905 --> 00:22:03.952
I am.

00:22:04.031 --> 00:22:05.453
Trying to get me back in the world?

00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.622
Trying to save it.

00:22:12.540 --> 00:22:14.588
HYDRA'S secret weapon.

00:22:14.750 --> 00:22:16.548
Howard Stark fished that
out of the ocean

00:22:16.627 --> 00:22:17.799
when he was looking for you.

00:22:18.629 --> 00:22:19.972
He thought what we think.

00:22:20.548 --> 00:22:24.394
The Tesseract could be the key
to unlimited sustainable energy.

00:22:25.135 --> 00:22:28.730
That's something
the world sorely needs.

00:22:30.474 --> 00:22:31.691
Who took it from you?

00:22:31.851 --> 00:22:33.319
He's called Loki.

00:22:33.477 --> 00:22:35.775
He's not from around here.

00:22:36.605 --> 00:22:38.699
There's a lot we'll have to
bring you up to speed on

00:22:38.774 --> 00:22:40.026
if you're in.

00:22:40.943 --> 00:22:42.661
The world has gotten even stranger

00:22:42.778 --> 00:22:43.904
than you already know.

00:22:44.655 --> 00:22:46.999
At this point, I doubt
anything would surprise me.

00:22:47.867 --> 00:22:49.289
Ten bucks says you're wrong.

00:22:51.287 --> 00:22:52.709
There's a debriefing packet

00:22:52.788 --> 00:22:55.211
waiting for you back at your apartment.

00:22:57.376 --> 00:22:59.344
Is there anything you can
tell us about the Tesseract

00:22:59.628 --> 00:23:00.845
that we ought to know now?

00:23:01.130 --> 00:23:03.474
You should have left it in the ocean.

00:23:36.165 --> 00:23:39.044
Good to go on this end.
The rest is up to you.

00:23:39.209 --> 00:23:40.586
You disconnected
the transmission lines?

00:23:40.669 --> 00:23:41.761
Are we off the grid?

00:23:41.837 --> 00:23:44.010
Stark Tower is about to become
a beacon

00:23:44.131 --> 00:23:45.474
of self-sustaining clean energy.

00:23:45.716 --> 00:23:47.810
Well, assuming
the arc reactor takes over

00:23:47.885 --> 00:23:49.182
and it actually works.

00:23:49.470 --> 00:23:50.813
I assume.

00:23:51.013 --> 00:23:52.014
Light her up.

00:23:57.853 --> 00:23:58.854
How does it look?

00:23:59.021 --> 00:24:01.695
Like Christmas, but with more me.

00:24:01.857 --> 00:24:03.484
We've got to go wider on
the public awareness campaign.

00:24:03.567 --> 00:24:04.659
You need to do some press.

00:24:05.235 --> 00:24:06.327
I'm in DC tomorrow,

00:24:06.403 --> 00:24:07.905
I'm working on the zoning
for the next three buildings.

00:24:07.988 --> 00:24:10.207
Pepper, you're killing me.
The moment, remember?

00:24:10.741 --> 00:24:11.867
Enjoy the moment.

00:24:11.951 --> 00:24:12.952
Get in here and I will.

00:24:16.538 --> 00:24:19.462
Sir, Agent Coulson of
S.H.I.E.L.D. is on the line.

00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.047
I'm not in.

00:24:21.669 --> 00:24:23.046
I'm actually out.

00:24:30.177 --> 00:24:32.896
Sir, I'm afraid he's insisting.

00:24:33.055 --> 00:24:35.524
Grow a spine, Jarvis. I got a date.

00:24:40.312 --> 00:24:43.316
Levels are holding steady, I think.

00:24:43.482 --> 00:24:45.701
Of course they are.
I was directly involved.

00:24:45.859 --> 00:24:47.076
Which brings me to my next question.

00:24:47.194 --> 00:24:49.242
How does it feel to be a genius?

00:24:49.405 --> 00:24:51.658
Well, I really wouldn't know,
now would I?

00:24:51.824 --> 00:24:56.375
What do you mean?
All this came from you.

00:24:56.537 --> 00:24:59.916
No, all this came from that.

00:25:00.374 --> 00:25:02.502
Give yourself some credit. Please.

00:25:02.876 --> 00:25:04.719
Stark Tower is your baby.

00:25:04.878 --> 00:25:07.006
Give yourself 12% of the credit.

00:25:07.506 --> 00:25:08.632
12%?

00:25:08.757 --> 00:25:09.974
An argument can be made for 15.

00:25:10.259 --> 00:25:11.852
12%? My baby?

00:25:12.011 --> 00:25:13.684
Well, I did do all the heavy lifting.

00:25:13.762 --> 00:25:15.264
Literally, I lifted the heavy things.

00:25:15.848 --> 00:25:18.192
And, sorry, but the security snafu?

00:25:18.267 --> 00:25:19.769
That was on you.

00:25:19.852 --> 00:25:21.820
- My private elevator...
- You mean our elevator?

00:25:22.146 --> 00:25:24.865
...It was teeming with sweaty workmen.

00:25:25.024 --> 00:25:27.447
I'm going to pay for that
comment about percentages

00:25:27.609 --> 00:25:29.236
in some subtle way later, aren't I?

00:25:29.987 --> 00:25:31.284
It's not going to be that subtle.

00:25:31.447 --> 00:25:32.744
I'll tell you what.

00:25:32.906 --> 00:25:35.204
The next building is gonna
say "Potts" on the tower.

00:25:35.451 --> 00:25:36.748
On the lease.

00:25:37.870 --> 00:25:40.043
Call your mom. Can you bunk over?

00:25:40.205 --> 00:25:41.502
Sir, the telephone.

00:25:41.665 --> 00:25:44.134
I'm afraid my protocols
are being overridden.

00:25:44.293 --> 00:25:46.011
Mr. Stark, we need to talk.

00:25:46.295 --> 00:25:48.673
You have reached the life
model decoy of Tony Stark.

00:25:49.089 --> 00:25:50.966
- Please leave a message.
- This is urgent.

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:53.098
Then leave it urgently.

00:25:54.636 --> 00:25:55.808
Security breach. It's on you.

00:25:55.971 --> 00:25:58.599
- Mr. Stark.
- Phil! Come in.

00:25:58.682 --> 00:25:59.683
"Phil"?

00:25:59.808 --> 00:26:00.855
I can't stay.

00:26:01.185 --> 00:26:02.437
His first name is "Agent."

00:26:02.895 --> 00:26:04.192
Come on in. We're celebrating.

00:26:04.271 --> 00:26:06.114
Which is why he can't stay.

00:26:06.482 --> 00:26:08.484
We need you to look this over
as soon as possible.

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:09.697
I don't like being handed things.

00:26:09.860 --> 00:26:11.157
That's fine, because
I love to be handed things.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.697
So, let's trade.

00:26:14.239 --> 00:26:15.786
Thank you.

00:26:16.950 --> 00:26:19.044
Official consulting hours
are between 8 and 5

00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:20.120
every other Thursday.

00:26:20.496 --> 00:26:21.497
This isn't a consultation.

00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:22.672
Is this about the Avengers?

00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:25.171
Which I know nothing about.

00:26:25.334 --> 00:26:27.883
The Avengers Initiative
was scrapped, I thought.

00:26:28.045 --> 00:26:29.297
And I didn't even qualify.

00:26:29.379 --> 00:26:30.380
I didn't know that either.

00:26:30.798 --> 00:26:33.722
Apparently I'm volatile, self-obsessed,

00:26:33.801 --> 00:26:34.927
don't play well with others.

00:26:35.344 --> 00:26:36.391
That I did know.

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:38.188
This isn't about personality
profiles any more.

00:26:38.263 --> 00:26:40.686
Whatever. Ms. Potts, got a second?

00:26:40.849 --> 00:26:41.850
Half a mo.

00:26:47.106 --> 00:26:49.279
You know, I thought we were
having a moment.

00:26:49.691 --> 00:26:50.988
I was having 12% of a moment.

00:26:52.444 --> 00:26:54.947
This seems serious.
Phil's pretty shaken.

00:26:55.114 --> 00:26:57.116
How would you know if it's...
Why is he "Phil"?

00:26:57.282 --> 00:26:59.080
What is all this?

00:26:59.243 --> 00:27:00.870
This is

00:27:01.495 --> 00:27:02.496
this.

00:27:09.837 --> 00:27:10.963
I'm going to take the jet to DC tonight.

00:27:11.046 --> 00:27:12.172
Tomorrow.

00:27:12.381 --> 00:27:14.725
You have homework.
You have a lot of homework.

00:27:15.050 --> 00:27:16.768
Well, what if I didn't?

00:27:17.386 --> 00:27:18.763
- If you didn't?
- Yeah.

00:27:18.929 --> 00:27:21.148
You mean when you've finished?

00:27:22.224 --> 00:27:25.524
Well, then...

00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:31.737
Square deal. Fly safe.

00:27:36.196 --> 00:27:37.368
Work hard.

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.998
So, any chance
you're driving by LaGuardia?

00:27:42.161 --> 00:27:44.960
- I can drop you.
- Fantastic.

00:27:45.038 --> 00:27:46.085
I want to hear

00:27:46.165 --> 00:27:47.917
about the cellist. Is that still a thing?

00:27:48.041 --> 00:27:49.258
She moved back to Portland.

00:27:49.418 --> 00:27:52.137
What? Boo!

00:28:00.554 --> 00:28:03.023
We're about 40 minutes
out from home base, sir.

00:28:06.685 --> 00:28:10.406
So, this Dr. Banner was trying
to replicate the serum they used on me?

00:28:10.564 --> 00:28:12.157
A lot of people were.

00:28:12.316 --> 00:28:13.784
You were the world's first superhero.

00:28:14.651 --> 00:28:17.450
Banner thought gamma radiation
might hold the key to unlocking

00:28:17.529 --> 00:28:18.781
Erskine's original formula.

00:28:19.615 --> 00:28:21.083
Didn't really go his way, did it?

00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:23.202
Not so much.

00:28:23.368 --> 00:28:25.962
When he's not that thing, though,
the guy's like a Stephen Hawking.

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:30.463
He's like a smart person.

00:28:32.669 --> 00:28:33.886
I gotta say.

00:28:34.004 --> 00:28:36.473
It's an honour to meet you officially.

00:28:37.549 --> 00:28:39.142
I've sort of met you. I mean,

00:28:39.218 --> 00:28:40.811
I watched you while you were sleeping.

00:28:42.846 --> 00:28:45.144
I mean, I was present

00:28:45.265 --> 00:28:48.644
while you were
unconscious from the ice.

00:28:48.769 --> 00:28:51.113
You know, it's really just a huge honour

00:28:51.188 --> 00:28:52.940
to have you on board this...

00:28:53.523 --> 00:28:55.446
I hope I'm the man for the job.

00:28:55.609 --> 00:28:58.533
Oh, you are. Absolutely.

00:28:58.695 --> 00:29:01.665
We made some modifications
to the uniform.

00:29:01.823 --> 00:29:03.325
I had a little design input.

00:29:03.492 --> 00:29:04.744
The uniform?

00:29:04.993 --> 00:29:07.496
Aren't the stars and stripes a little

00:29:08.413 --> 00:29:09.835
old-fashioned?

00:29:10.791 --> 00:29:12.759
With everything that's happening

00:29:12.834 --> 00:29:14.507
and the things that are about
to come to light,

00:29:15.462 --> 00:29:18.966
people might just need
a little old-fashioned.

00:29:51.707 --> 00:29:54.711
The Chitauri grow restless.

00:29:54.876 --> 00:29:56.628
Let them gird themselves.

00:29:56.712 --> 00:29:58.385
I will lead them in the glorious battle.

00:29:58.463 --> 00:29:59.555
Battle?

00:30:00.674 --> 00:30:03.803
Against the meagre might of Earth?

00:30:03.969 --> 00:30:06.848
Glorious, not lengthy.

00:30:07.014 --> 00:30:10.894
If your force
is as formidable as you claim.

00:30:11.059 --> 00:30:13.312
You question us?

00:30:13.729 --> 00:30:15.902
You question him,

00:30:16.023 --> 00:30:18.526
he who put the scepter in your hand?

00:30:18.692 --> 00:30:21.411
Who gave you ancient knowledge
and new purpose

00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:24.827
when you were cast out, defeated?

00:30:24.906 --> 00:30:26.829
I was a king!

00:30:26.992 --> 00:30:29.245
The rightful king of Asgard,

00:30:29.369 --> 00:30:30.416
betrayed.

00:30:31.371 --> 00:30:33.920
Your ambition is little

00:30:33.999 --> 00:30:36.752
and born of childish need.

00:30:37.169 --> 00:30:39.217
We look beyond the Earth

00:30:39.379 --> 00:30:42.132
to the greater worlds
the Tesseract will unveil.

00:30:42.591 --> 00:30:44.093
You don't have the Tesseract yet.

00:30:46.803 --> 00:30:47.804
I don't threaten.

00:30:49.598 --> 00:30:52.192
But until I open the doors,

00:30:52.351 --> 00:30:56.026
until your force is mine to command,

00:30:56.730 --> 00:30:58.573
you are but words.

00:30:58.732 --> 00:31:02.737
You will have your war, Asgardian.

00:31:04.488 --> 00:31:06.536
If you fail,

00:31:07.491 --> 00:31:11.962
if the Tesseract is kept from us,

00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:16.500
there will be no realm, no barren moon,

00:31:16.666 --> 00:31:20.011
no crevice where he cannot find you.

00:31:21.546 --> 00:31:24.345
You think you know pain?

00:31:24.508 --> 00:31:29.935
He will make you long
for something sweet as pain.

00:31:59.376 --> 00:32:00.468
Stow the captain's gear.

00:32:00.544 --> 00:32:01.591
Yes, sir.

00:32:03.088 --> 00:32:06.262
Agent Romanoff, Captain Rogers.

00:32:06.425 --> 00:32:07.768
- Ma'am.
- Hi.

00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:08.927
They need you on the bridge.

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:10.557
They're starting the face-trace.

00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:11.846
See you there.

00:32:13.557 --> 00:32:17.437
It was quite the buzz around here,
finding you in the ice.

00:32:17.978 --> 00:32:20.606
I thought Coulson was gonna swoon.

00:32:20.772 --> 00:32:23.696
Did he ask you to sign
his Captain America trading cards yet?

00:32:23.859 --> 00:32:25.111
Trading cards?

00:32:25.277 --> 00:32:27.279
They're vintage. He's very proud.

00:32:29.197 --> 00:32:30.540
Dr. Banner.

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.543
Yeah, hi.

00:32:34.035 --> 00:32:35.287
They told me you would be coming.

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:36.713
Word is, you can find the Cube.

00:32:38.081 --> 00:32:39.674
Is that the only word on me?

00:32:40.041 --> 00:32:41.258
Only word I care about.

00:32:44.129 --> 00:32:46.473
It must be strange for you, all of this.

00:32:47.257 --> 00:32:49.976
Well, this is actually kind of familiar.

00:32:50.051 --> 00:32:52.725
Gentlemen, you might want
to step inside in a minute.

00:32:53.096 --> 00:32:55.895
It's going to get a little hard to breathe.

00:32:56.850 --> 00:32:58.397
Flight crew, secure the deck.

00:33:03.148 --> 00:33:04.775
Is this a submarine?

00:33:05.317 --> 00:33:06.318
Really?

00:33:06.401 --> 00:33:10.247
They want me in a submerged,
pressurized, metal container'?

00:33:36.264 --> 00:33:38.642
No, no, this is much worse.

00:34:08.797 --> 00:34:11.516
Hover power check complete.
Position cyclic.

00:34:11.675 --> 00:34:13.803
Increase collective to 8.0 %.

00:34:19.182 --> 00:34:21.526
Preparing for maximum
performance takeoff.

00:34:21.643 --> 00:34:23.145
Increase output to capacity.

00:34:23.270 --> 00:34:25.443
Power plant performing at capacity.

00:34:25.605 --> 00:34:27.152
We are clear.

00:34:27.315 --> 00:34:28.817
All engines operating.

00:34:28.984 --> 00:34:33.660
S.H.I.E.L.D. Emergency
Protocol 193.6 in effect.

00:34:33.863 --> 00:34:36.491
- We are at level, sir.
- Good.

00:34:36.825 --> 00:34:37.826
Let's vanish.

00:34:37.993 --> 00:34:40.166
Engage retro-reflection panels.

00:34:56.011 --> 00:34:57.228
Reflection panels engaged.

00:34:57.971 --> 00:34:59.393
Gentlemen.

00:35:11.359 --> 00:35:12.531
Doctor, thank you for coming.

00:35:14.863 --> 00:35:16.740
Thanks for asking nicely.

00:35:16.906 --> 00:35:19.375
So, how long am I staying?

00:35:19.743 --> 00:35:21.336
Once we get our hands on
the Tesseract,

00:35:21.411 --> 00:35:22.663
you're in the wind.

00:35:22.746 --> 00:35:24.623
Where are you with that?

00:35:24.706 --> 00:35:26.549
We're sweeping every
wirelessly accessible

00:35:26.625 --> 00:35:27.626
camera on the planet.

00:35:28.335 --> 00:35:30.212
Cell phones, laptops...

00:35:30.879 --> 00:35:34.053
If it's connected to a satellite,
it's eyes and ears for us.

00:35:34.132 --> 00:35:35.429
That's still not gonna find them in time.

00:35:35.508 --> 00:35:36.600
You have to narrow your field.

00:35:36.718 --> 00:35:38.766
How many spectrometers
do you have access to?

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.893
- How many are there?
- Call every lab you know.

00:35:41.056 --> 00:35:42.808
Tell them to put
the spectrometers on the roof

00:35:42.891 --> 00:35:44.234
and calibrate them for gamma rays.

00:35:44.517 --> 00:35:47.521
I'll rough out a tracking algorithm,
basic cluster recognition.

00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:50.281
At least we could rule out a few places.

00:35:50.690 --> 00:35:52.567
Do you have somewhere
for me to work?

00:35:52.901 --> 00:35:53.948
Agent Romanoff,

00:35:54.027 --> 00:35:56.155
could you show Dr. Banner
to his laboratory, please?

00:35:57.322 --> 00:35:59.495
You're gonna love it, Doc.
We got all the toys.

00:36:00.241 --> 00:36:02.084
Put it over there.

00:36:03.995 --> 00:36:06.168
Where did you find all these people?

00:36:06.331 --> 00:36:09.175
S.H.I.E.L.D. has no shortage
of enemies, Doctor.

00:36:09.751 --> 00:36:10.923
Is this the stuff you need?

00:36:11.086 --> 00:36:12.087
Yeah, iridium.

00:36:12.170 --> 00:36:14.844
It's found in meteorites.
It forms anti-protons.

00:36:15.006 --> 00:36:16.679
It's very hard to get hold of.

00:36:16.841 --> 00:36:18.559
Especially if S.H.I.E.L.D.
knows you need it.

00:36:18.635 --> 00:36:20.057
Well, I didn't know.

00:36:20.178 --> 00:36:21.430
Hey!

00:36:21.596 --> 00:36:23.724
The Tesseract has shown me so much.

00:36:24.349 --> 00:36:26.192
It's more than knowledge. It's truth.

00:36:26.267 --> 00:36:27.268
I know.

00:36:28.061 --> 00:36:29.904
What did it show you, Agent Barton?

00:36:31.106 --> 00:36:32.449
My next target.

00:36:32.524 --> 00:36:33.525
Tell me what you need.

00:36:37.195 --> 00:36:39.072
I need a distraction.

00:36:39.823 --> 00:36:41.291
And an eyeball.

00:36:47.872 --> 00:36:50.546
I mean, if it's not too much trouble.

00:36:50.625 --> 00:36:51.717
No, no. It's fine.

00:36:54.963 --> 00:36:56.636
It's a vintage set.

00:36:56.798 --> 00:36:59.096
It took me a couple of years
to collect them all.

00:37:01.636 --> 00:37:02.728
Near mint.

00:37:02.887 --> 00:37:04.309
Slight foxing around the edges, but...

00:37:04.472 --> 00:37:06.895
We got a hit. A 67% match.

00:37:07.267 --> 00:37:08.940
Wait. Cross match, 79%.

00:37:10.311 --> 00:37:11.312
Location?

00:37:11.646 --> 00:37:14.490
Stuttgart, Germany. 28 Konigstrasse.

00:37:14.649 --> 00:37:15.821
He's not exactly hiding.

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:16.992
Captain,

00:37:17.485 --> 00:37:18.486
You're up

00:39:54.100 --> 00:39:55.272
Kneel before me.

00:39:59.689 --> 00:40:01.032
I said

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:04.990
kneel!

00:40:14.537 --> 00:40:17.962
Is not this simpler?

00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:22.720
Is this not your natural state?

00:40:25.006 --> 00:40:28.226
It's the unspoken truth of humanity,

00:40:28.384 --> 00:40:30.807
that you crave subjugation.

00:40:31.346 --> 00:40:35.146
The bright lure of freedom
diminishes your life's joy

00:40:35.308 --> 00:40:37.777
in a mad scramble for power,

00:40:39.729 --> 00:40:41.197
for identity.

00:40:42.774 --> 00:40:46.199
You were made to be ruled.

00:40:46.486 --> 00:40:48.113
In the end,

00:40:48.655 --> 00:40:50.657
you will always kneel.

00:40:58.331 --> 00:41:00.049
Not to men like you.

00:41:01.334 --> 00:41:03.007
There are no men like me.

00:41:04.087 --> 00:41:06.840
There are always men like you.

00:41:08.257 --> 00:41:09.884
Look to your elder, people.

00:41:12.303 --> 00:41:13.600
Let him be an example.

00:41:20.561 --> 00:41:23.155
You know, the last time
I was in Germany,

00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:26.568
and saw a man standing
above everybody else,

00:41:26.734 --> 00:41:28.236
we ended up disagreeing.

00:41:28.403 --> 00:41:30.076
The soldier.

00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.537
The man out of time.

00:41:33.908 --> 00:41:35.251
I'm not the one who's out of time.

00:41:38.955 --> 00:41:41.253
Loki, drop the weapon
and stand down.

00:42:01.894 --> 00:42:03.521
Kneel.

00:42:03.604 --> 00:42:04.821
Not today!

00:42:06.941 --> 00:42:08.158
The guy's all over the place.

00:42:11.863 --> 00:42:14.036
Agent Romanoff. You miss me?

00:42:30.965 --> 00:42:33.093
Make your move, Reindeer Games.

00:42:41.309 --> 00:42:42.310
Good move.

00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:45.363
Mr. Stark.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:47.197
Captain.

00:42:54.363 --> 00:42:56.036
Is he saying anything?

00:42:56.199 --> 00:42:57.200
Not a word.

00:42:57.742 --> 00:42:59.585
Just get him here. We're low on time.

00:43:02.580 --> 00:43:03.581
I don't like it.

00:43:03.998 --> 00:43:06.000
What, Rock of Ages
giving up so easily?

00:43:06.125 --> 00:43:07.843
I don't remember it being that easy.

00:43:08.127 --> 00:43:09.595
This guy packs a wallop.

00:43:09.754 --> 00:43:13.384
Still, you are pretty spry
for an older fellow.

00:43:14.383 --> 00:43:15.930
What's your thing, Pilates?

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:17.011
What?

00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:18.267
It's like calisthenics.

00:43:18.346 --> 00:43:20.348
You might have missed
a couple of things

00:43:20.431 --> 00:43:22.104
doing time as a Capsicle.

00:43:24.227 --> 00:43:25.854
Fury didn't tell me
he was calling you in.

00:43:26.020 --> 00:43:28.739
Yeah, there's a lot of things
Fury doesn't tell you.

00:43:29.107 --> 00:43:30.734
Where's this coming from?

00:43:34.612 --> 00:43:37.286
What's the matter? Are you
scared of a little lightning?

00:43:37.698 --> 00:43:40.042
I'm not overly fond of what follows.

00:43:57.844 --> 00:43:59.061
What are you doing?

00:44:12.191 --> 00:44:13.659
And now there's that guy.

00:44:13.818 --> 00:44:15.616
Another Asgardian?

00:44:15.778 --> 00:44:17.655
- That guy's a friendly?
- Doesn't matter.

00:44:17.822 --> 00:44:20.450
If he frees Loki or kills him,
the Tesseract's lost.

00:44:20.616 --> 00:44:22.368
Stark, we need a plan of attack!

00:44:22.702 --> 00:44:24.830
I have a plan. Attack.

00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.678
I'd sit this one out, Cap.

00:44:32.962 --> 00:44:34.009
I don't see how I can.

00:44:34.172 --> 00:44:36.675
These guys come from legend.
They're basically gods.

00:44:37.258 --> 00:44:38.601
There's only one God, ma'am.

00:44:38.676 --> 00:44:41.099
And I'm pretty sure
he doesn't dress like that.

00:44:56.527 --> 00:44:57.779
Where is the Tesseract?

00:44:58.112 --> 00:44:59.455
I missed you, too.

00:44:59.822 --> 00:45:01.119
Do I look to be in a gaming mood?

00:45:01.741 --> 00:45:03.118
You should thank me.

00:45:03.826 --> 00:45:05.954
With the Bifrost gone,
how much dark energy

00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.873
did the Allfather have to
muster to conjure you here

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:10.212
to your precious Earth?

00:45:14.378 --> 00:45:15.721
I thought you dead.

00:45:17.298 --> 00:45:18.766
Did you mourn?

00:45:19.342 --> 00:45:20.969
We all did. Our father...

00:45:21.469 --> 00:45:24.188
Your father.

00:45:26.307 --> 00:45:29.186
He did tell you
my true parentage, did he not?

00:45:31.687 --> 00:45:33.985
We were raised together.

00:45:34.148 --> 00:45:36.822
We played together,
we fought together.

00:45:37.318 --> 00:45:38.535
Do you remember none of that?

00:45:38.694 --> 00:45:40.696
I remember a shadow.

00:45:42.156 --> 00:45:44.875
Living in the shade of your greatness.

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:48.584
I remember you tossing me
into an abyss.

00:45:48.663 --> 00:45:50.711
I, who was, and should be, king!

00:45:51.165 --> 00:45:53.008
So you take the world I love
as a recompense

00:45:53.084 --> 00:45:55.007
for your imagined slights?

00:45:55.169 --> 00:45:58.264
No. The Earth is under
my protection, Loki.

00:45:59.674 --> 00:46:02.974
And you're doing
a marvelous job with that.

00:46:03.678 --> 00:46:05.726
The humans slaughter
each other in droves

00:46:05.805 --> 00:46:07.648
while you idly fret.

00:46:07.723 --> 00:46:09.942
I mean to rule them,
as why should I not?

00:46:10.101 --> 00:46:11.398
You think yourself above them?

00:46:12.770 --> 00:46:13.771
Well, yes.

00:46:13.938 --> 00:46:16.441
Then you miss the truth
of ruling, brother.

00:46:16.941 --> 00:46:18.363
A throne would suit you ill.

00:46:23.864 --> 00:46:26.367
I've seen worlds
you've never known about!

00:46:26.701 --> 00:46:30.831
I have grown, Odinson, in my exile.

00:46:31.372 --> 00:46:33.374
I have seen the true power
of the Tesseract,

00:46:33.666 --> 00:46:34.633
and when I wield it...

00:46:34.709 --> 00:46:36.552
Who showed you this power?

00:46:37.545 --> 00:46:38.967
Who controls the would-be king?

00:46:39.213 --> 00:46:41.056
- I am a king!
- Not here!

00:46:41.215 --> 00:46:42.512
You give up the Tesseract!

00:46:42.591 --> 00:46:45.219
You give up this poisonous dream!

00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:49.057
You come home.

00:46:53.978 --> 00:46:55.150
I don't have it.

00:46:57.189 --> 00:46:59.362
You need the Cube to bring me home.

00:46:59.567 --> 00:47:01.444
But I've sent it off, I know not where.

00:47:02.778 --> 00:47:04.701
You listen well, brother.

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.537
I'm listening.

00:47:16.917 --> 00:47:18.385
Do not touch me again.

00:47:18.586 --> 00:47:20.179
Then don't take my stuff.

00:47:20.254 --> 00:47:22.598
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

00:47:24.467 --> 00:47:25.468
Shakespeare in the Park?

00:47:26.927 --> 00:47:30.101
Doth Mother know
you wear-eth her drapes?

00:47:30.473 --> 00:47:33.272
This is beyond you, metal man.

00:47:33.434 --> 00:47:35.232
Loki will face Asgardian justice.

00:47:35.770 --> 00:47:39.149
He gives up the Cube,
he's all yours. Until then,

00:47:39.273 --> 00:47:40.525
stay out of the way.

00:47:42.318 --> 00:47:43.911
Tourist.

00:47:49.116 --> 00:47:50.208
Okay.

00:48:20.147 --> 00:48:23.151
Power at 400% capacity.

00:48:23.317 --> 00:48:24.569
How about that?

00:49:24.920 --> 00:49:26.217
Hey!

00:49:28.883 --> 00:49:30.180
That's enough.

00:49:33.846 --> 00:49:35.519
Now, I don't know
what you plan on doing here.

00:49:35.598 --> 00:49:38.147
I've come here to put an end
to Loki's schemes.

00:49:38.225 --> 00:49:40.694
Then prove it. Put that hammer down.

00:49:40.769 --> 00:49:41.770
Yeah... No.

00:49:42.021 --> 00:49:43.489
Bad call. He loves his hammer.

00:49:45.399 --> 00:49:47.401
You want me to put the hammer down?

00:50:14.970 --> 00:50:16.688
Are we done, here?

00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:07.524
In case it's unclear,

00:51:08.190 --> 00:51:10.033
if you try to escape,

00:51:11.110 --> 00:51:13.204
if you so much as scratch that glass,

00:51:22.997 --> 00:51:26.718
it's 30,000 feet straight down
in a steel trap.

00:51:27.501 --> 00:51:29.674
You get how that works?

00:51:31.672 --> 00:51:34.346
Ant, boot.

00:51:37.636 --> 00:51:39.183
It's an impressive cage.

00:51:40.306 --> 00:51:42.684
Not built, I think, for me.

00:51:43.267 --> 00:51:45.190
Built for something
a lot stronger than you.

00:51:45.894 --> 00:51:47.862
Oh, I've heard.

00:51:48.522 --> 00:51:49.739
A mindless beast.

00:51:50.983 --> 00:51:52.360
Makes play he's still a man.

00:51:53.694 --> 00:51:55.947
How desperate are you,

00:51:56.113 --> 00:51:59.242
that you call on such
lost creatures to defend you?

00:51:59.408 --> 00:52:01.536
How desperate am I?

00:52:01.952 --> 00:52:03.829
You threaten my world with war.

00:52:03.996 --> 00:52:06.169
You steal a force
you can't hope to control.

00:52:06.332 --> 00:52:10.178
You talk about peace,
and you kill because it's fun.

00:52:10.336 --> 00:52:13.385
You have made me very desperate.

00:52:13.547 --> 00:52:15.299
You might not be glad that you did.

00:52:18.719 --> 00:52:22.064
It burns you to have come so close.

00:52:23.432 --> 00:52:25.901
To have the Tesseract, to have power,

00:52:26.935 --> 00:52:29.233
unlimited power.

00:52:29.396 --> 00:52:31.398
And for what?

00:52:32.983 --> 00:52:36.613
A warm light for all mankind to share.

00:52:37.071 --> 00:52:40.200
And then to be reminded
what real power is.

00:52:44.411 --> 00:52:48.507
Well, let me know if "real power"
wants a magazine or something.

00:52:56.965 --> 00:52:58.467
He really grows on you, doesn't he?

00:52:58.676 --> 00:53:00.599
Loki's gonna drag this out.

00:53:00.761 --> 00:53:04.265
So, Thor, what's his play?

00:53:04.431 --> 00:53:07.059
He has an army called the Chitauri.

00:53:07.226 --> 00:53:10.150
They're not of Asgard,
nor any world known.

00:53:10.562 --> 00:53:12.690
He means to lead them
against your people.

00:53:12.856 --> 00:53:14.483
They will win him the Earth,

00:53:14.566 --> 00:53:16.409
in return, I suspect, for the Tesseract.

00:53:16.568 --> 00:53:18.320
An army

00:53:18.487 --> 00:53:20.239
from outer space.

00:53:20.406 --> 00:53:22.829
So, he's building another portal.

00:53:22.991 --> 00:53:24.288
That's what he needs Erik Selvig for.

00:53:24.368 --> 00:53:25.369
Selvig?

00:53:25.619 --> 00:53:28.042
- He's an astrophysicist.
- He's a friend.

00:53:28.205 --> 00:53:30.378
Loki has him under some kind of spell,

00:53:30.457 --> 00:53:32.004
along with one of ours.

00:53:32.167 --> 00:53:33.840
I want to know why Loki let us take him.

00:53:33.919 --> 00:53:35.262
He's not leading an army from here.

00:53:35.421 --> 00:53:37.139
I don't think
we should be focusing on Loki.

00:53:37.297 --> 00:53:39.174
That guy's brain is a bag full of cats.

00:53:39.258 --> 00:53:40.510
You could smell crazy on him.

00:53:40.759 --> 00:53:42.432
Have care how you speak.

00:53:43.053 --> 00:53:44.976
Loki is beyond reason,
but he is of Asgard.

00:53:45.472 --> 00:53:46.598
And he is my brother.

00:53:46.890 --> 00:53:48.688
He killed 80 people in two days.

00:53:49.643 --> 00:53:50.644
He's adopted.

00:53:50.853 --> 00:53:53.197
I think it's about the mechanics.

00:53:53.355 --> 00:53:55.357
Iridium... What do they
need the iridium for?

00:53:55.482 --> 00:53:56.483
It's a stabilizing agent.

00:53:56.692 --> 00:53:58.035
I'm just saying, pick a weekend.

00:53:58.152 --> 00:53:59.699
I'll fly you to Portland.

00:53:59.862 --> 00:54:01.489
Keep love alive.

00:54:01.655 --> 00:54:03.578
It means the portal
won't collapse on itself

00:54:03.657 --> 00:54:05.580
like it did at S.H.I.E.L.D.

00:54:05.743 --> 00:54:09.043
No hard feelings, Point Break.
You've got a mean swing.

00:54:09.204 --> 00:54:11.502
Also, it means the portal
can open as wide

00:54:11.665 --> 00:54:14.168
and stay open as long, as Loki wants.

00:54:14.835 --> 00:54:16.837
Raise the mizzenmast. Jib the topsails.

00:54:18.547 --> 00:54:19.764
That man is playing Galaga.

00:54:21.008 --> 00:54:24.387
He thought we wouldn't notice,
but we did.

00:54:26.180 --> 00:54:27.557
How does Fury even see these?

00:54:27.639 --> 00:54:28.686
He turns.

00:54:29.183 --> 00:54:30.856
Sounds exhausting.

00:54:31.852 --> 00:54:33.104
The rest of the raw materials,

00:54:33.270 --> 00:54:36.069
Agent Barton can get
his hands on pretty easily.

00:54:36.231 --> 00:54:37.699
The only major component
he still needs

00:54:37.858 --> 00:54:41.362
is a power source
of high-energy density.

00:54:41.528 --> 00:54:44.657
Something to kick-start the Cube.

00:54:45.032 --> 00:54:47.751
When did you become an expert
in thermonuclear astrophysics?

00:54:47.826 --> 00:54:48.918
Last night.

00:54:49.703 --> 00:54:52.923
The packet, Selvig's notes,
the extraction theory papers.

00:54:53.081 --> 00:54:54.128
Am I the only one who did the reading?

00:54:54.291 --> 00:54:57.090
Does Loki need any particular
kind of power source?

00:54:57.252 --> 00:55:00.051
He would have to heat the Cube
to 120-million Kelvin

00:55:00.214 --> 00:55:01.716
just to break through
the Coulomb barrier.

00:55:01.882 --> 00:55:04.135
Unless Selvig has figured out
how to stabilize

00:55:04.301 --> 00:55:05.427
the quantum tunneling effect.

00:55:05.594 --> 00:55:06.811
Well, if he could do that,

00:55:06.887 --> 00:55:09.356
he could achieve heavy ion fusion
at any reactor on the planet.

00:55:09.431 --> 00:55:11.900
Finally, someone who speaks English.

00:55:12.059 --> 00:55:13.936
Is that what just happened?

00:55:14.228 --> 00:55:16.276
It's good to meet you, Dr. Banner.

00:55:16.438 --> 00:55:19.567
Your work on anti electron
collisions is unparalleled.

00:55:19.733 --> 00:55:21.576
And I'm a huge fan of the way
you lose control

00:55:21.735 --> 00:55:23.612
and turn into an enormous
green rage-monster.

00:55:25.322 --> 00:55:26.414
Thanks.

00:55:26.573 --> 00:55:29.076
Dr. Banner is only here
to track the Cube.

00:55:29.243 --> 00:55:30.586
I was hoping you might join him.

00:55:30.744 --> 00:55:31.745
I would start with that stick of his.

00:55:32.079 --> 00:55:33.046
It may be magical,

00:55:33.121 --> 00:55:34.589
but it works an awful lot
like a HYDRA weapon.

00:55:34.665 --> 00:55:37.589
I don't know about that,
but it is powered by the Cube.

00:55:37.960 --> 00:55:39.712
And I would like to know
how Loki used it

00:55:39.920 --> 00:55:41.593
to turn two of the sharpest men I know

00:55:41.672 --> 00:55:43.424
into his personal flying monkeys.

00:55:43.799 --> 00:55:45.301
Monkeys? I do not understand.

00:55:45.551 --> 00:55:46.393
I do.

00:55:49.471 --> 00:55:51.098
I understood that reference.

00:55:52.266 --> 00:55:53.643
Shall we play, Doctor?

00:55:53.809 --> 00:55:55.436
This way, sir.

00:56:09.533 --> 00:56:11.126
The gamma readings
are definitely consistent

00:56:11.285 --> 00:56:13.083
with Selvig's reports of the Tesseract.

00:56:13.704 --> 00:56:15.377
But it's going to take weeks to process.

00:56:15.539 --> 00:56:16.791
If we bypass their mainframe

00:56:16.874 --> 00:56:18.171
and direct route to the Homer cluster,

00:56:18.333 --> 00:56:21.462
we can clock this
at around 600 teraflops.

00:56:22.629 --> 00:56:24.631
All I packed was a toothbrush.

00:56:25.632 --> 00:56:27.305
You know, you should come by
Stark Tower sometime.

00:56:27.467 --> 00:56:29.469
Top ten floors, all R&D.

00:56:29.803 --> 00:56:31.305
You'd love it. It's Candy Land.

00:56:31.471 --> 00:56:34.065
Thanks, but the last time
I was in New York,

00:56:34.224 --> 00:56:36.818
I kind of broke Harlem.

00:56:36.977 --> 00:56:38.820
Well, I promise
a stress-free environment.

00:56:38.979 --> 00:56:40.822
No tension, no surprises.

00:56:42.316 --> 00:56:43.738
- Hey!
- Nothing?

00:56:43.859 --> 00:56:44.906
Are you nuts?

00:56:44.985 --> 00:56:45.986
Jury's out.

00:56:46.194 --> 00:56:47.411
You really have got
a lid on it, haven't you?

00:56:47.487 --> 00:56:48.488
What's your secret?

00:56:48.614 --> 00:56:50.082
Mellow jazz, bongo drums,
huge bag of weed?

00:56:50.157 --> 00:56:51.158
Is everything a joke to you?

00:56:51.617 --> 00:56:52.618
Funny things are.

00:56:52.826 --> 00:56:54.578
Threatening the safety
of everyone on this ship

00:56:54.661 --> 00:56:55.958
isn't funny.

00:56:56.038 --> 00:56:57.039
No offence, Doc.

00:56:57.122 --> 00:56:58.749
It's all right,
I wouldn't have come aboard

00:56:58.832 --> 00:57:01.711
if I couldn't handle pointy things.

00:57:01.793 --> 00:57:04.171
You're tip-toeing, big man.
You need to strut.

00:57:04.504 --> 00:57:06.222
And you need to focus
on the problem, Mr. Stark.

00:57:06.298 --> 00:57:07.675
Do you think I'm not?

00:57:07.925 --> 00:57:10.769
Why did Fury call us in?
Why now? Why not before?

00:57:10.844 --> 00:57:12.562
What isn't he telling us?

00:57:12.638 --> 00:57:14.185
I can't do the equation unless
I have all the variables.

00:57:14.806 --> 00:57:16.149
You think Fury's hiding something?

00:57:16.475 --> 00:57:19.649
He's a spy. Captain, he's "the" spy.

00:57:19.728 --> 00:57:21.571
His secrets have secrets.

00:57:21.647 --> 00:57:23.194
It's bugging him, too. Isn't it?

00:57:25.359 --> 00:57:26.861
I just want to finish my work here, and...

00:57:27.527 --> 00:57:28.528
Doctor?

00:57:34.034 --> 00:57:36.457
"A warm light for all mankind."

00:57:36.536 --> 00:57:38.538
Loki's jab at Fury about the Cube.

00:57:38.747 --> 00:57:39.999
I heard it.

00:57:40.082 --> 00:57:42.426
I think that was meant for you.

00:57:43.335 --> 00:57:46.339
Even if Barton didn't
tell Loki about the tower,

00:57:46.421 --> 00:57:47.468
it was still all over the news.

00:57:47.673 --> 00:57:49.641
The Stark Tower? That big, ugly

00:57:50.884 --> 00:57:52.101
building in New York?

00:57:52.427 --> 00:57:56.182
It's powered by an arc reactor,
a self-sustaining energy source.

00:57:56.264 --> 00:57:58.767
That building will run itself
for, what, a year?

00:57:58.850 --> 00:58:00.693
It's just the prototype.

00:58:00.769 --> 00:58:02.646
I'm kind of the only name
in clean energy right now.

00:58:03.063 --> 00:58:04.485
That's what he's getting at.

00:58:04.564 --> 00:58:07.238
So, why didn't S.H.I.E.L.D. bring him in
on the Tesseract project?

00:58:07.401 --> 00:58:09.199
What are they doing
in the energy business

00:58:09.277 --> 00:58:10.574
in the first place?

00:58:10.737 --> 00:58:13.741
I should probably look into that
once my decryption programme

00:58:13.865 --> 00:58:15.833
finishes breaking into all of
S.H.I.E.L.D.'s secure files.

00:58:15.909 --> 00:58:16.876
I'm sorry. Did you say...

00:58:16.952 --> 00:58:19.080
Jarvis has been running it
since I hit the bridge.

00:58:19.413 --> 00:58:21.006
In a few hours,
I'll know every dirty secret

00:58:21.081 --> 00:58:22.333
S.H.I.E.L.D. has ever tried to hide.

00:58:22.416 --> 00:58:23.383
Blueberry?

00:58:23.458 --> 00:58:25.210
Yet you're confused about why
they didn't want you around.

00:58:25.544 --> 00:58:28.172
An intelligence organization
that fears intelligence'?

00:58:28.505 --> 00:58:30.132
Historically, not awesome.

00:58:30.215 --> 00:58:32.513
I think Loki's trying to wind us up.

00:58:32.592 --> 00:58:34.219
This is a man who means to start a war

00:58:34.302 --> 00:58:35.770
and if we don't stay focused,
he'll succeed.

00:58:37.055 --> 00:58:39.558
We have orders.
We should follow them.

00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:41.943
Following's not really my style.

00:58:43.311 --> 00:58:45.734
And you're all about style, aren't you?

00:58:45.814 --> 00:58:46.906
Of the people in this room,

00:58:46.982 --> 00:58:48.655
which one is,
A, wearing a spangly outfit,

00:58:48.734 --> 00:58:49.906
and, B, not of use?

00:58:50.152 --> 00:58:54.282
Steve, tell me none of this
smells a little funky to you.

00:58:56.992 --> 00:58:58.084
Just find the Cube.

00:59:10.964 --> 00:59:12.966
That's the guy
my dad never shut up about?

00:59:13.592 --> 00:59:16.436
I'm wondering if they shouldn't have
kept him on ice.

00:59:17.179 --> 00:59:18.931
The guy's not wrong about Loki.

00:59:19.014 --> 00:59:20.857
He does have the jump on us.

00:59:20.932 --> 00:59:23.685
What he's got is an Acme dynamite kit.

00:59:23.769 --> 00:59:25.612
It's going to blow up in his face.

00:59:25.687 --> 00:59:27.815
And I'm going to be there when it does.

00:59:28.315 --> 00:59:30.488
Yeah. I'll read all about it.

00:59:32.402 --> 00:59:33.745
Or you'll be suiting up
with the rest of us.

00:59:35.489 --> 00:59:39.084
You see, I don't get a suit of armour.

00:59:39.159 --> 00:59:42.584
I'm exposed. Like a nerve.

00:59:42.662 --> 00:59:44.164
It's a nightmare.

00:59:44.498 --> 00:59:47.377
I've got a cluster of shrapnel
trying every second

00:59:47.459 --> 00:59:49.507
to crawl its way into my heart.

00:59:49.586 --> 00:59:51.680
This stops it.

00:59:51.755 --> 00:59:53.928
This little circle of light,
it's part of me now,

00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:56.847
not just armour.

00:59:57.636 --> 00:59:59.934
It's a terrible privilege.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:02.683
- But you can control it.
- Because I learned how.

01:00:02.766 --> 01:00:03.767
It's different.

01:00:04.267 --> 01:00:07.612
Hey, I read all about your accident.

01:00:07.687 --> 01:00:10.907
That much gamma exposure
should have killed you.

01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:13.694
So you're saying that the Hulk...

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:17.285
The other guy saved my life?

01:00:17.781 --> 01:00:18.953
That's nice.

01:00:19.991 --> 01:00:23.712
It's a nice sentiment. Saved it for what?

01:00:25.038 --> 01:00:26.881
I guess we'll find out.

01:00:28.708 --> 01:00:30.426
You may not enjoy that.

01:00:30.502 --> 01:00:32.504
And you just might.

01:01:31.688 --> 01:01:33.110
As soon as Loki took the doctor,

01:01:33.440 --> 01:01:34.987
we moved Jane Foster.

01:01:35.066 --> 01:01:37.489
They've got an excellent
observatory in Tromso.

01:01:37.569 --> 01:01:41.164
She was asked to consult there
very suddenly yesterday.

01:01:41.239 --> 01:01:45.085
Handsome fee, private plane,
very remote.

01:01:45.785 --> 01:01:46.877
She'll be safe.

01:01:47.078 --> 01:01:48.455
Thank you.

01:01:50.248 --> 01:01:52.091
It's no accident, Loki taking Erik Selvig.

01:01:53.293 --> 01:01:55.716
I dread what he plans for him
once he's done.

01:01:55.795 --> 01:01:56.967
Erik is a good man.

01:01:57.047 --> 01:01:58.094
He talks about you a lot.

01:02:00.133 --> 01:02:02.135
You changed his life.

01:02:03.803 --> 01:02:05.726
You changed everything around here.

01:02:05.805 --> 01:02:07.978
They were better as they were.

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:10.686
We pretend on Asgard
that we're more advanced

01:02:10.769 --> 01:02:14.524
but we come here,
battling like bilge snipe.

01:02:14.606 --> 01:02:16.483
- Like what?
- Bilge snipe.

01:02:16.566 --> 01:02:19.319
You know, huge, scaly, big antlers.

01:02:20.403 --> 01:02:22.246
- You don't have those?
- I don't think so.

01:02:22.322 --> 01:02:24.245
Well, they are repulsive.

01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:27.836
And they trample everything
in their path.

01:02:35.460 --> 01:02:38.760
When I first came to Earth,
Loki's rage followed me here,

01:02:38.922 --> 01:02:41.095
and your people paid the price.

01:02:41.341 --> 01:02:43.184
And now, again.

01:02:45.679 --> 01:02:48.182
In my youth, I courted war.

01:02:49.933 --> 01:02:51.981
War hasn't started yet.

01:02:53.061 --> 01:02:54.904
You think you could make Loki tell us

01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:56.277
where the Tesseract is?

01:02:56.356 --> 01:02:59.701
I do not know. Loki's mind is far afield.

01:02:59.776 --> 01:03:04.532
It's not just power he craves,
it's vengeance, upon me.

01:03:04.614 --> 01:03:06.457
There's no pain
would prise his need from him.

01:03:07.826 --> 01:03:10.079
A lot of guys think that

01:03:10.161 --> 01:03:11.413
until the pain starts.

01:03:13.957 --> 01:03:15.459
What are you asking me to do?

01:03:15.542 --> 01:03:19.046
I'm asking,
what are you prepared to do?

01:03:19.212 --> 01:03:20.213
Loki is a prisoner.

01:03:20.463 --> 01:03:22.807
Then why do I feel like
he's the only person on this boat

01:03:22.882 --> 01:03:24.259
that wants to be here?

01:03:37.063 --> 01:03:40.237
There's not many people
who can sneak up on me.

01:03:40.317 --> 01:03:41.910
But you figured I'd come.

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:44.074
After.

01:03:45.071 --> 01:03:48.575
After whatever tortures
Fury can concoct,

01:03:48.658 --> 01:03:52.379
you would appear
as a friend, as a balm.

01:03:53.246 --> 01:03:54.839
And I would cooperate.

01:03:55.081 --> 01:03:56.958
I want to know what
you've done to Agent Barton.

01:03:57.208 --> 01:03:59.051
I would say I've expanded his mind.

01:04:01.755 --> 01:04:03.757
And once you've won,

01:04:04.257 --> 01:04:05.600
once you're king of the mountain,

01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:10.560
what happens to his mind?

01:04:11.765 --> 01:04:13.392
Is this love, Agent Romanoff?

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:16.311
Love is for children. I owe him a debt.

01:04:20.398 --> 01:04:22.116
Tell me.

01:04:26.613 --> 01:04:29.913
Before I worked for S.H.I.E.L.D... I...

01:04:32.285 --> 01:04:36.210
Well, I made a name for myself.

01:04:36.289 --> 01:04:39.384
I have a very specific skill set.

01:04:39.459 --> 01:04:42.884
I didn't care who I used it for, or on.

01:04:44.130 --> 01:04:47.430
I got on S.H.I.E.L.D.'s radar
in a bad way.

01:04:48.802 --> 01:04:51.772
Agent Barton was sent to kill me.

01:04:52.764 --> 01:04:54.141
He made a different call.

01:04:56.267 --> 01:04:59.146
And what will you do
if I vow to spare him?

01:04:59.562 --> 01:05:00.984
Not let you out.

01:05:01.064 --> 01:05:02.987
No, but I like this.

01:05:03.942 --> 01:05:07.196
Your world in the balance,
and you bargain for one man.

01:05:07.487 --> 01:05:09.581
Regimes fall every day.

01:05:09.656 --> 01:05:12.034
I tend not to weep over that.
I'm Russian.

01:05:12.117 --> 01:05:13.164
Or I was.

01:05:14.661 --> 01:05:16.163
And what are you now?

01:05:16.788 --> 01:05:19.792
It's really not that complicated.

01:05:19.874 --> 01:05:24.004
I got red in my ledger,
I'd like to wipe it out.

01:05:24.963 --> 01:05:26.340
Can you?

01:05:27.841 --> 01:05:31.687
Can you wipe out that much red?

01:05:32.804 --> 01:05:34.351
Dreykov's daughter,

01:05:36.015 --> 01:05:37.892
Sao Paulo,

01:05:38.893 --> 01:05:41.237
the hospital fire?

01:05:42.230 --> 01:05:44.608
Barton told me everything.

01:05:44.691 --> 01:05:47.570
Your ledger is dripping. It's gushing red

01:05:47.819 --> 01:05:50.493
and you think saving a man
no more virtuous than yourself

01:05:50.572 --> 01:05:51.949
will change anything?

01:05:52.031 --> 01:05:54.784
This is the basest sentimentality.

01:05:54.868 --> 01:05:57.121
This is a child at prayer.

01:05:57.203 --> 01:05:58.375
Pathetic!

01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:01.958
You lie and kill

01:06:02.041 --> 01:06:05.136
in the service of liars and killers.

01:06:08.173 --> 01:06:11.222
You pretend to be separate,
to have your own code,

01:06:11.468 --> 01:06:14.221
something that makes up
for the horrors.

01:06:15.346 --> 01:06:17.815
But they are part of you.

01:06:17.891 --> 01:06:21.486
And they will never go away.

01:06:22.270 --> 01:06:25.820
I won't touch Barton,
not until I make him kill you.

01:06:25.899 --> 01:06:28.152
Slowly, intimately,

01:06:28.234 --> 01:06:30.703
in every way he knows you fear.

01:06:30.778 --> 01:06:33.622
And then he'll wake just long
enough to see his good work

01:06:33.990 --> 01:06:37.494
and when he screams, I'll split his skull.

01:06:37.660 --> 01:06:40.413
This is my bargain, you mewling quim.

01:06:42.248 --> 01:06:43.921
You're a monster.

01:06:46.085 --> 01:06:47.587
Oh, no.

01:06:48.463 --> 01:06:49.760
You brought the monster.

01:06:53.051 --> 01:06:54.428
So, Banner.

01:06:55.428 --> 01:06:56.600
That's your play.

01:06:56.846 --> 01:06:57.847
What?

01:06:58.848 --> 01:07:00.475
Loki means to unleash the Hulk.

01:07:00.558 --> 01:07:02.105
Keep Banner in the lab. I'm on my way.

01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:03.277
Send Thor as well.

01:07:05.313 --> 01:07:06.314
Thank you

01:07:06.564 --> 01:07:08.783
for your cooperation.

01:07:16.241 --> 01:07:17.709
What are you doing, Mr. Stark?

01:07:17.784 --> 01:07:20.378
Kind of been wondering
the same thing about you.

01:07:20.787 --> 01:07:22.380
You're supposed to be locating
the Tesseract.

01:07:22.455 --> 01:07:23.752
We are. The model's locked

01:07:23.957 --> 01:07:25.504
and we're sweeping
for the signature now.

01:07:25.583 --> 01:07:26.880
When we get a hit,

01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.462
we'll have the location
within half a mile.

01:07:28.795 --> 01:07:33.050
Yeah, then you get your
Cube back. No muss, no fuss.

01:07:33.132 --> 01:07:34.179
What is "Phase 2"?

01:07:36.511 --> 01:07:39.390
Phase 2 is S.H.I.E.L.D. uses
the Cube to make weapons.

01:07:39.472 --> 01:07:41.270
Sorry, computer was moving
a little slow for me.

01:07:41.641 --> 01:07:44.064
Rogers, we gathered everything
related to the Tesseract.

01:07:44.143 --> 01:07:45.440
This does not mean that we're making...

01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:46.521
I'm sorry, Nick.

01:07:46.604 --> 01:07:48.982
What were you lying?

01:07:49.065 --> 01:07:50.362
I was wrong, Director.

01:07:50.483 --> 01:07:51.575
The world hasn't changed a bit.

01:07:51.651 --> 01:07:52.652
Did you know about this?

01:07:52.986 --> 01:07:54.659
You want to think about
removing yourself

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:55.863
from this environment, Doctor?

01:07:55.947 --> 01:07:57.824
I was in Calcutta.
I was pretty well removed.

01:07:58.116 --> 01:07:59.459
Loki is manipulating you.

01:07:59.659 --> 01:08:01.036
And you've been doing what, exactly?

01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:02.666
You didn't come here because
I bat my eyelashes at you.

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:03.997
Yes, and I'm not leaving

01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.457
because suddenly
you get a little twitchy.

01:08:05.707 --> 01:08:07.380
I'd like to know why S.H.I.E.L.D.

01:08:07.458 --> 01:08:11.088
is using the Tesseract
to build weapons of mass destruction.

01:08:11.796 --> 01:08:12.968
Because of him.

01:08:13.840 --> 01:08:14.841
Me?

01:08:16.175 --> 01:08:18.598
Last year, Earth had a visitor
from another planet

01:08:18.678 --> 01:08:21.898
who had a grudge match
that leveled a small town.

01:08:21.973 --> 01:08:24.101
We learned that
not only are we not alone

01:08:24.309 --> 01:08:27.939
but we are hopelessly,
hilariously, outgunned.

01:08:28.021 --> 01:08:30.149
My people want nothing
but peace with your planet.

01:08:30.356 --> 01:08:32.404
But you're not the only people
out there, are you'?

01:08:32.483 --> 01:08:34.360
And you're not the only threat.

01:08:34.527 --> 01:08:37.531
The world's filling up with
people who can't be matched,

01:08:38.197 --> 01:08:39.540
that can't be controlled.

01:08:39.741 --> 01:08:40.913
Like you controlled the Cube?

01:08:40.992 --> 01:08:42.289
Your work with the Tesseract

01:08:42.368 --> 01:08:44.962
is what drew Loki to it, and his allies.

01:08:45.038 --> 01:08:46.506
It is a signal to all the realms

01:08:46.581 --> 01:08:49.300
that the Earth is ready
for a higher form of war.

01:08:49.375 --> 01:08:50.467
A higher form?

01:08:50.543 --> 01:08:51.669
You forced our hand.

01:08:51.753 --> 01:08:52.754
We had to come up with something.

01:08:52.837 --> 01:08:53.838
A nuclear deterrent.

01:08:53.921 --> 01:08:56.015
Because that always
calms everything right down.

01:08:56.090 --> 01:08:58.513
Remind me again how
you made your fortune, Stark.

01:08:58.593 --> 01:09:00.766
I'm sure if he still made weapons,
Stark would be neck-deep...

01:09:01.054 --> 01:09:02.772
Hold on. How is this now about me?

01:09:02.847 --> 01:09:03.973
I'm sorry, isn't everything?

01:09:04.057 --> 01:09:06.025
I thought humans were
more evolved than this.

01:09:06.100 --> 01:09:09.024
Excuse me, did we come to
your planet and blow stuff up?

01:09:09.103 --> 01:09:10.980
You treat your champions
with such mistrust.

01:09:11.064 --> 01:09:12.611
Are you boys really that naive?

01:09:12.690 --> 01:09:14.613
S.H.I.E.L.D. monitors potential threats.

01:09:14.692 --> 01:09:16.035
Captain America's on threat watch?

01:09:16.110 --> 01:09:17.111
We all are.

01:09:17.195 --> 01:09:18.697
Wait, you're on that list?

01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:20.373
Are you above or below angry bees?

01:09:20.448 --> 01:09:22.621
Stark, so help me God,
if you make one more wisecrack...

01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:23.997
Threat! Verbal threat. I feel threatened.

01:09:24.077 --> 01:09:26.580
- Show some respect.
- Respect what?

01:09:33.920 --> 01:09:36.890
Transport Six-Six-Bravo,
please relay confirm codes.

01:09:36.964 --> 01:09:39.183
I've got you on the computer,
but not on the day log.

01:09:39.258 --> 01:09:41.352
What is your haul? Over.

01:09:41.427 --> 01:09:43.850
Arms and ammunition. Over.

01:09:52.438 --> 01:09:54.691
You speak of control,
yet you court chaos.

01:09:54.774 --> 01:09:56.367
That's his M.O., isn't it?

01:09:56.609 --> 01:09:57.861
I mean, what are we, a team?

01:09:57.944 --> 01:10:00.993
No, we're a chemical mixture
that makes chaos.

01:10:01.072 --> 01:10:02.790
We're a time bomb.

01:10:03.116 --> 01:10:05.039
You need to step away.

01:10:05.118 --> 01:10:06.995
Why shouldn't the guy
let off a little steam?

01:10:07.078 --> 01:10:09.206
You know damn well why. Back off!

01:10:09.288 --> 01:10:11.541
I'm starting to want you to make me.

01:10:11.624 --> 01:10:15.254
Yeah. Big man in a suit of armour.

01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:16.672
Take that off, what are you?

01:10:16.963 --> 01:10:19.261
Genius, billionaire,
playboy, philanthropist.

01:10:20.216 --> 01:10:23.220
I know guys with none of that
worth ten of you.

01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:24.394
I've seen the footage.

01:10:24.637 --> 01:10:26.639
The only thing you really
fight for is yourself.

01:10:28.266 --> 01:10:30.234
You're not the guy
to make the sacrifice play,

01:10:30.393 --> 01:10:32.737
to lay down on a wire and let
the other guy crawl over you.

01:10:32.979 --> 01:10:34.902
I think I would just cut the wire.

01:10:37.775 --> 01:10:40.028
Always a way out.

01:10:40.111 --> 01:10:41.408
You may not be a threat

01:10:41.487 --> 01:10:43.330
but you better stop pretending
to be a hero.

01:10:43.489 --> 01:10:46.038
A hero? Like you?

01:10:46.117 --> 01:10:48.211
You're a laboratory experiment, Rogers.

01:10:48.286 --> 01:10:51.711
Everything special about you
came out of a bottle.

01:11:17.190 --> 01:11:19.784
Put on the suit. Let's go a few rounds.

01:11:21.027 --> 01:11:24.531
You people are so petty and tiny.

01:11:24.822 --> 01:11:25.664
Yeah, this is a team.

01:11:25.740 --> 01:11:26.866
Agent Romanoff, would you escort

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:27.996
Dr. Banner back to his...

01:11:28.159 --> 01:11:29.832
Where? You rented my room.

01:11:30.161 --> 01:11:31.788
The cell was just in case...

01:11:32.038 --> 01:11:33.290
In case you needed to kill me.

01:11:33.372 --> 01:11:36.046
But you can't. I know, I tried.

01:11:39.045 --> 01:11:41.969
I got low. I didn't see an end.

01:11:42.048 --> 01:11:46.428
So, I put a bullet in my mouth,
and the other guy spit it out.

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:48.388
So I moved on.

01:11:48.471 --> 01:11:51.065
I focused on helping
other people. I was good.

01:11:51.390 --> 01:11:53.563
Until you dragged me back
into this freak show

01:11:53.726 --> 01:11:54.898
and put everyone here at risk.

01:11:55.269 --> 01:11:57.397
You want to know my secret,
Agent Romanoff?

01:11:57.480 --> 01:11:59.073
You want to know how I stay calm?

01:12:02.109 --> 01:12:04.077
Dr. Banner,

01:12:04.946 --> 01:12:06.323
put down the scepter.

01:12:15.164 --> 01:12:16.381
Got it.

01:12:16.916 --> 01:12:17.963
Sorry, kids,

01:12:18.084 --> 01:12:19.927
you don't get to see
my party trick after all.

01:12:20.044 --> 01:12:21.091
You located the Tesseract?

01:12:21.212 --> 01:12:22.213
I could get there fastest.

01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:24.474
The Tesseract belongs on Asgard.
No human is a match for it.

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:25.891
- You're not going alone.
- You're gonna stop me?

01:12:26.008 --> 01:12:27.055
Put on the suit, let's find out.

01:12:27.218 --> 01:12:28.435
I'm not afraid to hit an old man.

01:12:28.511 --> 01:12:29.512
Put on the suit.

01:12:32.557 --> 01:12:33.934
Oh, my God.

01:12:49.699 --> 01:12:50.700
Put on the suit.

01:12:50.783 --> 01:12:52.126
Yeah.

01:12:54.871 --> 01:12:56.623
All hands to stations.

01:13:00.751 --> 01:13:02.469
- Hill!
- External detonation.

01:13:02.670 --> 01:13:03.967
Number three engine is down.

01:13:04.046 --> 01:13:05.047
We've been hit.

01:13:05.131 --> 01:13:06.383
- Can they get it running?
- Fire in engine three!

01:13:06.465 --> 01:13:07.466
Talk to me.

01:13:07.550 --> 01:13:09.268
Turbine looks mostly intact

01:13:09.343 --> 01:13:11.266
but it's impossible to
get out there to make repairs

01:13:11.345 --> 01:13:12.813
while we're in the air.

01:13:12.889 --> 01:13:15.483
If we lose one more engine,
we won't be.

01:13:15.558 --> 01:13:17.606
Somebody's got to get outside
and patch that engine.

01:13:17.685 --> 01:13:19.153
- Stark, you copy that?
- I'm on it.

01:13:19.520 --> 01:13:22.649
Coulson, initiate defensive lockdown
in the detention section

01:13:22.732 --> 01:13:23.824
then get to the armory.

01:13:23.941 --> 01:13:24.988
Romanoff?

01:13:28.821 --> 01:13:29.993
We're okay.

01:13:32.617 --> 01:13:33.914
We're okay, right?

01:13:46.714 --> 01:13:47.966
- Keep that engine down!
- Yes, sir.

01:13:48.049 --> 01:13:49.767
Detention, wait for cameras to go dark.

01:13:49.842 --> 01:13:51.719
- Got it.
- Stay close.

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:54.976
Let's go, Level 4.

01:13:55.848 --> 01:13:58.476
Engine three. I'll meet you there.

01:14:06.859 --> 01:14:08.076
Doctor?

01:14:10.029 --> 01:14:11.030
Bruce?

01:14:11.697 --> 01:14:15.122
You got to fight it.
This is just what Loki wants.

01:14:16.452 --> 01:14:17.624
We're going to be okay. Listen to me.

01:14:17.703 --> 01:14:18.704
Are you hurt?

01:14:22.208 --> 01:14:24.176
We're going to be okay. All right?

01:14:24.543 --> 01:14:27.387
I swear on my life,
I will get you out of this.

01:14:27.672 --> 01:14:28.844
You will walk away and never ever...

01:14:28.923 --> 01:14:30.766
Your life?

01:14:47.233 --> 01:14:48.234
Bruce

01:15:25.396 --> 01:15:28.616
Bring the carrier about
to a 1-8-0, heading south!

01:15:28.691 --> 01:15:30.534
- Take us to the water!
- We're flying blind.

01:15:30.693 --> 01:15:32.616
Navigation's recalibrating
after the engine failure.

01:15:32.778 --> 01:15:34.280
Is the sun coming up?

01:15:35.322 --> 01:15:37.290
- Yes, sir.
- Then put it on the left.

01:15:37.616 --> 01:15:39.118
Get us over water.

01:15:39.452 --> 01:15:41.250
One more turbine goes down,
and we drop.

01:15:43.789 --> 01:15:45.132
Thanks.

01:15:48.419 --> 01:15:49.636
Stark!

01:15:52.298 --> 01:15:54.016
Stark, I'm here!

01:15:54.091 --> 01:15:55.308
Good.

01:15:56.802 --> 01:15:58.850
Let's see what we've got.

01:15:58.929 --> 01:16:00.556
I got to get this
superconducting coolant system

01:16:00.723 --> 01:16:01.724
back online

01:16:01.807 --> 01:16:03.354
before I can access the rotors,

01:16:03.434 --> 01:16:05.027
work on dislodging the debris.

01:16:07.521 --> 01:16:09.148
I need you to get to that
engine control panel

01:16:09.315 --> 01:16:12.945
and tell me which relays
are in overload position.

01:16:25.456 --> 01:16:26.833
What does it look like in there?

01:16:27.708 --> 01:16:30.052
It seems to run
on some form of electricity.

01:16:30.336 --> 01:16:31.929
Well, you're not wrong.

01:17:35.943 --> 01:17:38.662
We are not your enemies, Banner.

01:17:38.737 --> 01:17:39.784
Try to think!

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:51.792
Okay, the relays are intact.

01:17:52.042 --> 01:17:53.259
What's our next move?

01:17:53.586 --> 01:17:54.633
Even if I clear the rotors,

01:17:54.712 --> 01:17:56.885
this thing won't
re-engage without a jump.

01:17:57.089 --> 01:17:58.261
I'm going to have to
get in there and push.

01:17:58.591 --> 01:18:00.184
If that thing gets up to
speed, you'll get shredded.

01:18:00.467 --> 01:18:02.515
That stator control unit
can reverse the polarity

01:18:02.595 --> 01:18:03.938
long enough to disengage
maglev and that could...

01:18:04.096 --> 01:18:05.268
Speak English!

01:18:06.640 --> 01:18:07.812
You see that red lever?

01:18:09.226 --> 01:18:11.194
It will slow the rotors down
long enough for me to get out.

01:18:11.437 --> 01:18:13.110
Stand by it. Wait for my word.

01:19:05.866 --> 01:19:07.413
We need full evac
on the lower hangar bay.

01:19:10.871 --> 01:19:11.963
Grenade!

01:19:27.012 --> 01:19:28.434
We've got a perimeter breach!

01:19:28.514 --> 01:19:30.608
Hostiles are in S.H.I.E.L.D. gear.

01:19:30.683 --> 01:19:32.811
Call-outs at every junction.

01:19:40.025 --> 01:19:42.278
We have the Hulk and Thor
on Research Level 4.

01:19:42.361 --> 01:19:43.863
Levels 2 and 3 are dark.

01:19:44.071 --> 01:19:46.039
Sir, the Hulk will tear this place apart!

01:19:47.157 --> 01:19:48.204
Get his attention.

01:19:48.534 --> 01:19:52.755
Escort 6-0, proceed to
Wishbone and engage hostile.

01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:54.173
Don't get too close.

01:19:54.248 --> 01:19:55.374
Copy

01:20:07.553 --> 01:20:08.850
Target acquired.

01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:14.064
Target engaged.

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:27.247
Target angry, target angry!

01:21:35.808 --> 01:21:37.902
They're not getting through
here, so what the hell...

01:21:56.412 --> 01:21:58.710
Engine one is now in shut-down.

01:22:07.089 --> 01:22:09.308
We are in an uncontrolled descent.

01:22:09.383 --> 01:22:11.101
Sir, we've lost all power in engine one.

01:22:11.802 --> 01:22:13.679
It's Barton. He took out our systems.

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:16.265
He's headed for the detention level.

01:22:16.348 --> 01:22:18.350
Does anybody copy?

01:22:19.518 --> 01:22:21.691
This is Agent Romanoff.

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:23.272
I copy

01:22:27.568 --> 01:22:28.660
Stark, we're losing altitude.

01:22:28.986 --> 01:22:30.238
Yeah, I noticed.

01:22:59.349 --> 01:23:00.350
No!

01:23:08.108 --> 01:23:10.531
Are you ever not going to fall for that?

01:23:53.779 --> 01:23:56.123
The humans think us immortal.

01:23:57.157 --> 01:23:58.750
Should we test that?

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:02.462
Move away, please.

01:24:07.125 --> 01:24:08.468
You like this?

01:24:09.628 --> 01:24:12.632
We started working on the prototype
after you sent the Destroyer.

01:24:14.091 --> 01:24:16.139
Even I don't know what it does.

01:24:17.135 --> 01:24:18.432
Do you want to find out?

01:24:20.389 --> 01:24:21.641
No!

01:25:31.376 --> 01:25:32.844
Natasha?

01:26:04.368 --> 01:26:06.166
You're going to lose.

01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:09.255
Am I?

01:26:10.666 --> 01:26:13.215
It's in your nature.

01:26:15.337 --> 01:26:17.715
Your heroes are scattered.

01:26:17.798 --> 01:26:21.553
Your floating fortress falls from the sky.

01:26:21.635 --> 01:26:22.932
Where is my disadvantage?

01:26:23.929 --> 01:26:25.772
You lack conviction.

01:26:26.723 --> 01:26:27.770
I don't think I'm...

01:26:34.690 --> 01:26:36.283
So, that's what it does.

01:26:38.443 --> 01:26:40.116
All hands
to crash stations immediately.

01:27:08.932 --> 01:27:09.933
Captain, hit the lever.

01:27:10.600 --> 01:27:12.944
I need a minute here!

01:27:13.270 --> 01:27:14.396
Lever

01:27:14.479 --> 01:27:15.480
Now!

01:27:27.617 --> 01:27:28.789
Help!

01:28:04.362 --> 01:28:05.784
Sorry, boss.

01:28:05.864 --> 01:28:07.411
The god rabbited.

01:28:07.699 --> 01:28:09.201
Just stay awake.

01:28:09.284 --> 01:28:10.752
Eyes on me.

01:28:11.036 --> 01:28:12.413
No, I'm clocking out here.

01:28:12.704 --> 01:28:13.876
Not an option.

01:28:15.207 --> 01:28:17.209
It's okay, boss.

01:28:19.085 --> 01:28:21.179
This was never gonna work

01:28:21.254 --> 01:28:22.426
if they didn't have something

01:28:23.882 --> 01:28:25.350
to...

01:28:54.538 --> 01:28:56.415
Agent Coulson is down.

01:28:57.749 --> 01:28:59.501
A medical team is on
its way to your location.

01:28:59.584 --> 01:29:01.086
They're here.

01:29:04.256 --> 01:29:05.929
They called it.

01:29:22.148 --> 01:29:23.821
These were in Phil Coulson's jacket.

01:29:27.153 --> 01:29:29.326
I guess he never did
get you to sign them.

01:29:32.951 --> 01:29:34.669
We're dead in the air up here.

01:29:34.744 --> 01:29:37.873
Our communications,
the location of the Cube,

01:29:38.248 --> 01:29:40.421
Banner, Thor...

01:29:41.877 --> 01:29:43.629
I got nothing for you.

01:29:43.712 --> 01:29:46.636
I lost my one good eye.

01:29:49.634 --> 01:29:52.604
Maybe I had that coming.

01:29:56.892 --> 01:29:58.235
Yes.

01:29:59.311 --> 01:30:02.736
We were going to build
an arsenal with the Tesseract.

01:30:04.149 --> 01:30:06.072
I never put all my chips
on that number, though

01:30:06.151 --> 01:30:09.280
because I was playing
something even riskier.

01:30:13.158 --> 01:30:17.334
There was an idea, Stark knows this,

01:30:19.164 --> 01:30:22.589
called the Avengers Initiative.

01:30:23.752 --> 01:30:25.925
The idea was to bring together a group

01:30:26.004 --> 01:30:28.598
of remarkable people

01:30:29.341 --> 01:30:32.185
to see if they could become
something more.

01:30:33.511 --> 01:30:37.516
To see if they could work together
when we needed them to,

01:30:37.682 --> 01:30:40.982
to fight the battles that we never could.

01:30:43.939 --> 01:30:48.866
Phil Coulson died
still believing in that idea.

01:30:51.154 --> 01:30:52.872
In heroes.

01:31:00.872 --> 01:31:02.499
Well,

01:31:03.333 --> 01:31:06.052
It's an old-fashioned notion.

01:31:26.272 --> 01:31:28.616
You fell out of the sky.

01:31:42.831 --> 01:31:44.083
Did I hurt anybody?

01:31:44.416 --> 01:31:47.511
There's nobody around here to get hurt.

01:31:47.585 --> 01:31:50.930
You did scare the hell
out of some pigeons, though.

01:31:51.756 --> 01:31:52.848
Lucky.

01:31:52.924 --> 01:31:54.267
Or just good aim.

01:31:54.676 --> 01:31:55.973
You were awake when you fell.

01:31:58.304 --> 01:32:00.102
- You saw?
- The whole thing.

01:32:00.265 --> 01:32:01.938
Right through the ceiling.

01:32:02.267 --> 01:32:06.238
Big and green and buck-ass nude.

01:32:06.312 --> 01:32:07.484
Here.

01:32:08.815 --> 01:32:11.034
Didn't think those would
fit you until you shrunk down

01:32:11.109 --> 01:32:13.612
to a regular-size feller.

01:32:15.905 --> 01:32:17.248
Thank you.

01:32:17.991 --> 01:32:19.163
Are you an alien?

01:32:19.784 --> 01:32:21.001
What?

01:32:21.286 --> 01:32:22.663
From outer space, an alien.

01:32:23.204 --> 01:32:24.251
No.

01:32:24.873 --> 01:32:27.797
Well, then, son, you've got a condition.

01:32:38.595 --> 01:32:40.973
Clint. You're going to be all right.

01:32:44.476 --> 01:32:46.649
You know that?

01:32:47.437 --> 01:32:49.314
Is that what you know?

01:32:51.775 --> 01:32:54.654
I've got no window.

01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:56.658
I have to flush him out.

01:32:57.697 --> 01:32:59.574
You got to level out.
It's going to take time.

01:32:59.657 --> 01:33:01.079
You don't understand.

01:33:03.161 --> 01:33:06.165
Have you ever had someone
take your brain and play?

01:33:07.207 --> 01:33:11.462
Pull you out
and stuff something else in?

01:33:14.547 --> 01:33:16.720
Do you know what it's like
to be unmade?

01:33:18.510 --> 01:33:20.683
You know that I do.

01:33:28.186 --> 01:33:29.233
Why am I back?

01:33:30.647 --> 01:33:32.069
How did you get him out?

01:33:32.148 --> 01:33:34.867
Cognitive recalibration.

01:33:35.110 --> 01:33:37.659
I hit you really hard on the head.

01:33:37.737 --> 01:33:38.863
Thanks.

01:33:43.326 --> 01:33:44.873
Natasha...

01:33:45.537 --> 01:33:46.663
How many agents did I...

01:33:46.746 --> 01:33:48.293
Don't.

01:33:48.540 --> 01:33:50.634
Don't do that to yourself, Clint.

01:33:51.334 --> 01:33:53.086
This is Loki.

01:33:53.419 --> 01:33:55.797
This is monsters and magic,

01:33:55.880 --> 01:33:57.257
and nothing we were ever trained for.

01:33:57.423 --> 01:33:58.970
Loki, did he get away?

01:33:59.050 --> 01:34:00.051
Yeah.

01:34:00.677 --> 01:34:02.771
I don't suppose you know where.

01:34:03.054 --> 01:34:04.897
I didn't need to know.

01:34:04.973 --> 01:34:06.725
I didn't ask.

01:34:09.978 --> 01:34:12.231
He's going to
make his play soon, though.

01:34:12.605 --> 01:34:13.652
Today.

01:34:13.898 --> 01:34:15.024
We got to stop him.

01:34:15.650 --> 01:34:16.993
Yeah? Who's "we"?

01:34:17.193 --> 01:34:19.036
I don't know. Whoever's left.

01:34:20.530 --> 01:34:21.907
Well,

01:34:23.575 --> 01:34:25.748
if I put an arrow
through Loki's eye socket,

01:34:25.869 --> 01:34:28.588
I would sleep better, I suppose.

01:34:31.249 --> 01:34:32.751
Now you sound like you.

01:34:33.418 --> 01:34:34.920
But you don't.

01:34:37.088 --> 01:34:39.967
You're a spy, not a soldier.

01:34:40.049 --> 01:34:44.805
Now you want to wade into a war. Why?

01:34:46.556 --> 01:34:48.558
What did Loki do to you?

01:34:49.267 --> 01:34:51.736
He didn't. I just...

01:34:55.440 --> 01:34:56.987
Natasha.

01:34:59.068 --> 01:35:01.116
I've been compromised.

01:35:04.115 --> 01:35:06.038
I got red in my ledger.

01:35:08.369 --> 01:35:10.497
I would like to wipe it out.

01:35:26.471 --> 01:35:28.064
Was he married?

01:35:28.139 --> 01:35:29.561
No.

01:35:29.641 --> 01:35:33.942
There was a cellist, I think.

01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:36.948
I'm sorry.

01:35:37.607 --> 01:35:39.029
He seemed like a good man.

01:35:40.526 --> 01:35:41.698
He was an idiot.

01:35:41.778 --> 01:35:43.872
Why? For believing?

01:35:44.155 --> 01:35:45.577
For taking on Loki alone.

01:35:45.657 --> 01:35:47.409
He was doing his job.

01:35:47.492 --> 01:35:49.836
He was out of his league.
He should have waited.

01:35:49.911 --> 01:35:51.003
He should have...

01:35:51.329 --> 01:35:52.831
Sometimes there isn't a way out, Tony.

01:35:53.039 --> 01:35:55.258
Right, I've heard that before.

01:35:55.333 --> 01:35:56.505
Is this the first time you lost a soldier?

01:35:56.834 --> 01:35:58.461
We are not soldiers.

01:36:03.174 --> 01:36:04.767
I'm not marching to Fury's fife.

01:36:05.051 --> 01:36:06.268
Neither am I.

01:36:06.344 --> 01:36:08.597
He's got the same blood
on his hands that Loki does.

01:36:08.680 --> 01:36:10.102
But right now,
we got to put that behind us

01:36:10.181 --> 01:36:12.183
and get this done.

01:36:12.392 --> 01:36:13.393
Loki needs a power source.

01:36:13.476 --> 01:36:14.443
If we can put together a list...

01:36:14.519 --> 01:36:15.520
He made it personal.

01:36:15.853 --> 01:36:16.854
That's not the point.

01:36:17.021 --> 01:36:19.444
That is the point. That's Loki's point.

01:36:19.649 --> 01:36:21.322
He hit us all right where we live. Why?

01:36:21.693 --> 01:36:22.740
To tear us apart.

01:36:23.194 --> 01:36:24.696
Yeah, divide and conquer is great

01:36:24.779 --> 01:36:27.282
but he knows he has to
take us out to win, right?

01:36:27.365 --> 01:36:28.958
That's what he wants.

01:36:29.033 --> 01:36:31.286
He wants to beat us,
he wants to be seen doing it.

01:36:31.452 --> 01:36:32.544
He wants an audience.

01:36:33.538 --> 01:36:35.211
Right. I caught his act in Stuttgart.

01:36:35.290 --> 01:36:38.294
Yeah, that was just previews.
This is opening night.

01:36:38.376 --> 01:36:40.970
And Loki, he's a full-tilt diva, right?

01:36:41.045 --> 01:36:42.638
He wants flowers, he wants parades.

01:36:42.714 --> 01:36:46.218
He wants a monument built to the skies
with his name plastered...

01:36:48.261 --> 01:36:49.558
Son of a bitch.

01:37:00.398 --> 01:37:01.524
Time to go.

01:37:01.983 --> 01:37:03.485
- Go where?
- I'll tell you on the way.

01:37:03.735 --> 01:37:04.702
Can you fly one of those jets?

01:37:06.529 --> 01:37:07.530
I can.

01:37:11.284 --> 01:37:12.410
You got a suit?

01:37:12.618 --> 01:37:13.619
Yeah.

01:37:13.911 --> 01:37:15.163
Then suit up.

01:37:42.774 --> 01:37:44.151
Hey, you guys aren't
authorized to be in here.

01:37:44.275 --> 01:37:46.448
Son, just don't.

01:37:48.946 --> 01:37:49.913
Sir.

01:37:49.989 --> 01:37:50.990
Agent Hill.

01:37:51.741 --> 01:37:53.334
Those cards,

01:37:55.453 --> 01:37:59.458
they were in Coulson's locker
not in his jacket.

01:38:03.961 --> 01:38:05.588
They needed the push.

01:38:08.966 --> 01:38:11.139
We have an unauthorized departure
from Bay 6.

01:38:11.886 --> 01:38:13.263
They found him.

01:38:14.305 --> 01:38:18.060
Get our communications back up,
whatever you have to do.

01:38:18.142 --> 01:38:20.270
- I want eyes on everything.
- Yes, sir.

01:38:33.991 --> 01:38:35.743
Sir, I've turned off the arc reactor

01:38:35.827 --> 01:38:39.707
but the device
is already self-sustaining.

01:38:39.789 --> 01:38:42.008
Shut it down, Dr. Selvig.

01:38:42.291 --> 01:38:43.588
It's too late!

01:38:45.711 --> 01:38:47.213
She can't stop now.

01:38:48.506 --> 01:38:50.600
She wants to show us something!

01:38:50.842 --> 01:38:52.970
A new universe.

01:38:53.219 --> 01:38:54.391
Okay.

01:39:01.811 --> 01:39:03.779
The barrier is pure energy.

01:39:03.855 --> 01:39:05.482
It's unbreachable.

01:39:05.815 --> 01:39:07.658
Yeah, I got that.

01:39:08.526 --> 01:39:09.573
Plan B

01:39:10.987 --> 01:39:13.115
Sir, the Mark 7
is not ready for deployment.

01:39:13.197 --> 01:39:15.291
Then skip the spinning rims.
We're on the clock.

01:39:35.219 --> 01:39:37.938
Please tell me you're going
to appeal to my humanity.

01:39:39.223 --> 01:39:41.521
Actually, I'm planning to threaten you.

01:39:41.684 --> 01:39:43.152
You should have left
your armour on for that.

01:39:43.436 --> 01:39:44.904
Yeah.

01:39:44.979 --> 01:39:46.151
It's seen a bit of mileage,

01:39:46.230 --> 01:39:48.449
and you've got
the glow stick of destiny.

01:39:49.609 --> 01:39:51.737
Would you like a drink?

01:39:51.819 --> 01:39:53.036
Stalling me won't change anything.

01:39:53.279 --> 01:39:55.498
No, no. Threatening.

01:39:55.573 --> 01:39:56.665
No drink? Are you sure?

01:39:57.074 --> 01:39:58.621
I'm having one.

01:39:59.619 --> 01:40:03.590
The Chitauri are coming.
Nothing will change that.

01:40:04.415 --> 01:40:05.541
What have I to fear?

01:40:05.958 --> 01:40:07.426
The Avengers.

01:40:09.754 --> 01:40:12.132
That's what we call ourselves.
We're sort of like a team.

01:40:12.215 --> 01:40:13.888
"Earth's mightiest heroes" type thing.

01:40:13.966 --> 01:40:15.559
Yes, I've met them.

01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:16.852
Yeah.

01:40:17.136 --> 01:40:18.353
It takes us a while to get any traction,

01:40:18.429 --> 01:40:19.521
I'll give you that one.

01:40:19.597 --> 01:40:21.816
But let's do a head count, here.

01:40:21.891 --> 01:40:24.440
Your brother, the demigod,

01:40:26.103 --> 01:40:29.528
a super soldier, a living legend
who kind of lives up to the legend.

01:40:29.815 --> 01:40:33.035
A man with breathtaking
anger-management issues,

01:40:33.110 --> 01:40:36.034
a couple of master assassins,
and you, big fella,

01:40:36.822 --> 01:40:39.496
you've managed to piss off
every single one of them.

01:40:39.575 --> 01:40:40.622
That was the plan.

01:40:41.035 --> 01:40:43.083
Not a great plan.

01:40:43.162 --> 01:40:45.256
When they come,

01:40:45.331 --> 01:40:46.833
and they will,

01:40:46.916 --> 01:40:48.042
they'll come for you.

01:40:48.125 --> 01:40:49.172
I have an army.

01:40:49.252 --> 01:40:50.344
We have a Hulk.

01:40:51.087 --> 01:40:52.509
I thought the beast had wandered off.

01:40:52.588 --> 01:40:54.556
You're missing the point.
There is no throne.

01:40:54.632 --> 01:40:58.432
There is no version of this
where you come out on top.

01:40:58.803 --> 01:41:00.771
Maybe your army comes
and maybe it's too much for us,

01:41:00.972 --> 01:41:02.974
but it's all on you.

01:41:04.016 --> 01:41:05.142
Because if we can't protect the Earth,

01:41:05.268 --> 01:41:08.238
you can be damn well sure
we'll avenge it.

01:41:10.481 --> 01:41:13.530
How will your friends have time for me

01:41:13.609 --> 01:41:15.202
when they are so busy fighting you?

01:41:22.618 --> 01:41:23.665
This usually works.

01:41:23.786 --> 01:41:26.630
Well, performance issues,
it's not uncommon.

01:41:26.956 --> 01:41:28.629
One out of five...

01:41:30.334 --> 01:41:33.338
Jarvis, anytime now.

01:41:35.006 --> 01:41:37.805
You will all fall before me.

01:41:37.883 --> 01:41:39.135
Deploy!

01:41:39.385 --> 01:41:40.511
Deploy!

01:42:08.039 --> 01:42:11.043
And there's one other
person you pissed off.

01:42:11.876 --> 01:42:13.219
His name was Phil.

01:42:37.109 --> 01:42:38.656
Right.

01:42:38.736 --> 01:42:39.737
Army

01:43:52.351 --> 01:43:53.728
Loki!

01:43:53.811 --> 01:43:55.563
Turn off the Tesseract, or I'll destroy it.

01:43:55.646 --> 01:43:56.772
You can't.

01:43:56.897 --> 01:43:58.820
There is no stopping it.

01:43:59.108 --> 01:44:00.655
There is only

01:44:00.818 --> 01:44:01.990
the war.

01:44:02.153 --> 01:44:03.279
So be it.

01:44:25.176 --> 01:44:26.928
Stark, we're on your three,
headed northeast.

01:44:27.178 --> 01:44:29.180
What? Did you stop for drive-through?

01:44:29.263 --> 01:44:31.015
Swing up Park. I'm going
to lay them out for you.

01:44:49.408 --> 01:44:50.785
Sir, we have more incoming.

01:44:50.868 --> 01:44:52.370
Fine. Let's keep them occupied.

01:44:59.502 --> 01:45:01.049
- Nat?
- I see him.

01:45:45.756 --> 01:45:47.975
We got to get back up there.

01:46:39.310 --> 01:46:40.732
Stark, are you seeing this?

01:46:41.687 --> 01:46:43.860
Seeing. Still working on believing.

01:46:44.148 --> 01:46:45.525
Where's Banner?
Has he shown up yet?

01:46:45.649 --> 01:46:46.741
Banner?

01:46:46.817 --> 01:46:47.818
Just keep me posted.

01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:50.579
Jarvis, find me a soft spot.

01:46:53.157 --> 01:46:54.750
Look at this!

01:46:54.825 --> 01:46:55.826
Look around you!

01:46:57.161 --> 01:47:00.665
You think this madness
will end with your rule?

01:47:01.165 --> 01:47:02.667
It's too late.

01:47:04.168 --> 01:47:05.420
It's too late to stop it.

01:47:05.502 --> 01:47:09.052
No. We can, together.

01:47:16.013 --> 01:47:17.765
Sentiment.

01:47:46.001 --> 01:47:48.254
We've got civilians
still trapped up here.

01:47:49.254 --> 01:47:50.255
Loki.

01:48:01.850 --> 01:48:03.648
They're fish in a barrel down there.

01:48:09.274 --> 01:48:11.276
We got this. It's good. Go.

01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:12.577
Do you think you can hold them off?

01:48:12.653 --> 01:48:13.700
Captain,

01:48:15.864 --> 01:48:18.538
it would be my genuine pleasure.

01:48:45.561 --> 01:48:47.029
Just like Budapest all over again.

01:48:47.896 --> 01:48:50.115
You and I remember Budapest
very differently.

01:49:06.582 --> 01:49:07.583
It's going to be an hour

01:49:07.666 --> 01:49:09.043
before they can
scramble the National Guard.

01:49:09.126 --> 01:49:10.969
National Guard?

01:49:11.837 --> 01:49:13.180
Does the army know
what's happening here?

01:49:13.255 --> 01:49:14.256
Do we?

01:49:15.799 --> 01:49:17.051
You need men in these buildings.

01:49:17.134 --> 01:49:18.681
There are people inside and
they're going to be running

01:49:18.761 --> 01:49:20.013
right into the line of fire.

01:49:20.137 --> 01:49:22.060
You take them to the basements
or through the subway.

01:49:22.139 --> 01:49:23.766
You keep them off the streets.

01:49:23.849 --> 01:49:26.147
I need a perimeter as far back as 39th.

01:49:26.602 --> 01:49:27.979
Why the hell
should I take orders from you?

01:49:42.326 --> 01:49:43.543
I need men in those buildings.

01:49:43.619 --> 01:49:45.747
Lead the people down
and away from the streets.

01:49:45.829 --> 01:49:48.173
We're going to set up a perimeter
all the way down to 39th Street.

01:49:58.801 --> 01:50:00.178
Well, we got its attention.

01:50:00.511 --> 01:50:02.434
What the hell was step two?

01:50:31.917 --> 01:50:32.964
What's the story upstairs?

01:50:33.043 --> 01:50:35.011
The power surrounding the Cube
is impenetrable.

01:50:35.087 --> 01:50:37.761
Thor's right. We got
to deal with these guys.

01:50:37.840 --> 01:50:39.513
- How do we do this?
- As a team.

01:50:39.591 --> 01:50:40.717
I have unfinished business with Loki.

01:50:41.135 --> 01:50:42.182
Yeah? Well, get in line.

01:50:42.261 --> 01:50:43.262
Save it.

01:50:43.679 --> 01:50:45.147
Loki's going to keep
this fight focused on us,

01:50:45.222 --> 01:50:46.269
and that's what we need.

01:50:46.348 --> 01:50:48.066
Without him,
these things could run wild.

01:50:48.142 --> 01:50:50.736
We got Stark up top.
He's going to need us to...

01:50:58.443 --> 01:51:02.038
So, this all seems horrible.

01:51:02.531 --> 01:51:03.657
I've seen worse.

01:51:04.074 --> 01:51:05.166
Sorry.

01:51:05.367 --> 01:51:07.870
No, we could use a little worse.

01:51:08.287 --> 01:51:10.415
- Stark, we got him.
- Banner?

01:51:10.622 --> 01:51:11.919
Just like you said.

01:51:12.249 --> 01:51:14.843
Then tell him to suit up.
I'm bringing the party to you.

01:51:21.425 --> 01:51:23.177
I don't see how that's a party.

01:51:31.059 --> 01:51:32.060
Dr. Banner.

01:51:33.896 --> 01:51:35.739
Now might be a really good
time for you to get angry.

01:51:36.565 --> 01:51:39.114
That's my secret, Captain.

01:51:40.777 --> 01:51:42.120
I'm always angry.

01:51:53.790 --> 01:51:55.212
Hold on!

01:52:25.322 --> 01:52:26.699
Send the rest.

01:52:33.455 --> 01:52:34.752
Guys.

01:52:34.998 --> 01:52:36.250
Call it, Captain.

01:52:36.333 --> 01:52:37.585
All right, listen up.

01:52:37.668 --> 01:52:40.171
Until we can close that portal,
our priority is containment.

01:52:40.545 --> 01:52:41.922
Barton, I want you on that roof.

01:52:42.005 --> 01:52:43.928
Eyes on everything.
Call out patterns and strays.

01:52:44.007 --> 01:52:45.099
Stark, you got the perimeter.

01:52:45.175 --> 01:52:46.427
Anything gets
more than three blocks out,

01:52:46.551 --> 01:52:48.178
you turn it back or you turn it to ash.

01:52:48.512 --> 01:52:49.559
- Can you give me a lift?
- Right.

01:52:49.638 --> 01:52:50.764
Better clench up, Legolas.

01:52:54.518 --> 01:52:56.520
Thor, you got to try
and bottleneck that portal.

01:52:56.853 --> 01:52:57.979
Slow them down.

01:52:58.272 --> 01:53:00.149
You got the lightning.
Light the bastards up.

01:53:02.734 --> 01:53:04.031
You and me,
we stay here on the ground.

01:53:04.111 --> 01:53:05.283
We keep the fighting here.

01:53:05.362 --> 01:53:06.363
And Hulk...

01:53:09.032 --> 01:53:10.158
Smash.

01:54:04.087 --> 01:54:05.213
Sir.

01:54:05.964 --> 01:54:06.965
The Council is on.

01:54:12.095 --> 01:54:15.144
Stark, you got a lot of strays
sniffing your tail.

01:54:17.184 --> 01:54:19.061
I'm just trying to keep them
off the streets.

01:54:19.353 --> 01:54:21.321
Well, they can't bank worth a damn.

01:54:21.396 --> 01:54:22.613
So find a tight corner.

01:54:22.814 --> 01:54:24.236
I will roger that.

01:54:47.089 --> 01:54:48.306
Oh, boy.

01:54:55.514 --> 01:54:57.187
Nice call.

01:54:57.265 --> 01:54:58.517
What else you got?

01:54:58.600 --> 01:55:01.444
Thor is taking on
a squadron down on Sixth.

01:55:01.520 --> 01:55:03.488
And he didn't invite me.

01:55:43.228 --> 01:55:45.230
Captain, none of this
is going to mean a damn thing

01:55:45.313 --> 01:55:46.280
if we don't close that portal.

01:55:46.356 --> 01:55:47.608
Our biggest guns couldn't touch it.

01:55:47.983 --> 01:55:50.281
Well, maybe it's not about guns.

01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:54.072
If you want to get up there,
you're going to need a ride.

01:55:55.115 --> 01:55:56.241
I got a ride.

01:55:57.325 --> 01:55:58.372
I could use a boost, though.

01:56:01.037 --> 01:56:02.038
Are you sure about this?

01:56:02.706 --> 01:56:05.050
Yeah. It's gonna be fun.

01:56:32.235 --> 01:56:34.033
Okay, turn, turn.

01:56:34.237 --> 01:56:36.035
Less! Less!

01:57:58.655 --> 01:58:01.659
Captain, the bank
on 42nd past Madison.

01:58:01.741 --> 01:58:03.584
They've cornered
a lot of civilians in there.

01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:05.412
I'm on it.

01:58:25.682 --> 01:58:27.355
Everyone! Clear out!

01:58:57.380 --> 01:58:59.098
Director Fury,

01:58:59.174 --> 01:59:00.721
the Council has made a decision.

01:59:01.051 --> 01:59:03.850
I recognise the Council
has made a decision.

01:59:03.928 --> 01:59:05.601
But given that
it's a stupid-ass decision,

01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:07.148
I have elected to ignore it.

01:59:07.223 --> 01:59:10.318
Director, you're closer
than any of our subs.

01:59:10.393 --> 01:59:11.440
You scramble that jet...

01:59:11.561 --> 01:59:14.360
That is the island of Manhattan,
Councilman.

01:59:14.606 --> 01:59:16.779
Until I'm certain my team can't hold it,

01:59:16.858 --> 01:59:18.860
I will not order a nuclear strike

01:59:18.943 --> 01:59:20.286
against a civilian population.

01:59:20.528 --> 01:59:22.747
If we don't hold them here,
we lose everything.

01:59:23.073 --> 01:59:25.826
If I send that bird out, we already have.

01:59:29.579 --> 01:59:30.922
You.

01:59:33.541 --> 01:59:34.758
Hawkeye!

01:59:35.835 --> 01:59:36.836
Nat, what are you doing?

01:59:37.796 --> 01:59:38.797
A little help?

01:59:44.219 --> 01:59:45.220
I got him.

02:00:11.663 --> 02:00:12.664
Enough!

02:00:13.289 --> 02:00:15.508
You are, all of you, beneath me!

02:00:15.834 --> 02:00:18.678
I am a god, you dull creature.

02:00:18.753 --> 02:00:20.300
And I will not be bullied by...

02:00:29.806 --> 02:00:31.729
Puny god.

02:00:40.066 --> 02:00:41.613
The sceptre...

02:00:42.694 --> 02:00:43.991
Doctor.

02:00:45.822 --> 02:00:48.701
Loki's scepter. The energy.

02:00:48.783 --> 02:00:50.456
The Tesseract can't fight,

02:00:50.535 --> 02:00:52.378
but you can't protect against yourself.

02:00:52.537 --> 02:00:53.584
It's not your fault.

02:00:53.663 --> 02:00:54.755
You didn't know what you were doing.

02:00:58.168 --> 02:01:00.387
Actually, I think I did.

02:01:00.462 --> 02:01:03.466
I built in a safety
to cut their power source.

02:01:04.591 --> 02:01:06.093
Loki's scepter.

02:01:06.176 --> 02:01:08.804
It may be able to close the portal.

02:01:10.847 --> 02:01:12.690
And I'm looking right at it.

02:01:25.153 --> 02:01:28.657
Sir, we will lose power
before we penetrate that shell.

02:01:35.455 --> 02:01:38.800
Jarvis, you ever hear the tale of Jonah?

02:01:38.875 --> 02:01:41.048
I wouldn't consider him a role model.

02:02:50.864 --> 02:02:52.707
Director Fury is no longer in command.

02:02:52.782 --> 02:02:54.876
Override order 7-Alpha- 1- 1.

02:02:54.951 --> 02:02:57.420
7-Alpha-1-1, confirmed.
We're go for takeoff

02:02:58.454 --> 02:03:00.456
Sir, we have a bird in motion!

02:03:00.999 --> 02:03:02.797
Anyone on the deck,
we have a rogue bird.

02:03:03.126 --> 02:03:04.469
We need to shut it down!

02:03:04.544 --> 02:03:06.546
Repeat, takeoff is not authorized.

02:03:37.327 --> 02:03:39.546
Stark, do you hear me?

02:03:39.621 --> 02:03:41.589
You have a missile
headed straight for the city.

02:03:42.290 --> 02:03:43.712
How long?

02:03:43.791 --> 02:03:45.919
Three minutes, max.

02:03:46.002 --> 02:03:47.470
The payload
will wipe out Midtown.

02:03:47.712 --> 02:03:49.589
Jarvis, put everything we got
into the thrusters.

02:03:49.881 --> 02:03:51.599
1 just did.

02:04:04.312 --> 02:04:05.689
Package is sent.

02:04:05.897 --> 02:04:08.867
Detonation in
2 minutes, 30 seconds, mark.

02:04:31.798 --> 02:04:34.221
Are you ready for another bout?

02:04:34.676 --> 02:04:35.723
What, are you getting sleepy?

02:04:41.474 --> 02:04:43.272
Right at the crown!

02:04:49.232 --> 02:04:51.109
I can close it.

02:04:51.192 --> 02:04:52.910
Can anybody copy?

02:04:53.027 --> 02:04:54.244
I can shut the portal down.

02:04:54.570 --> 02:04:56.538
- Do it!
- No, wait.

02:04:56.614 --> 02:04:57.831
Stark, these things are still coming.

02:04:57.907 --> 02:04:58.908
I got a nuke coming in.

02:04:58.992 --> 02:05:00.869
It's gonna blow in less than a minute.

02:05:10.837 --> 02:05:12.510
And I know just where to put it.

02:05:19.887 --> 02:05:22.265
Stark, you know that's a one-way trip.

02:05:22.348 --> 02:05:23.770
Save the rest for the turn, J.

02:05:23.850 --> 02:05:28.026
Sir, shall I try Miss Potts?

02:05:28.104 --> 02:05:29.856
Might as well.

02:05:32.066 --> 02:05:34.489
The streets of New York City
have become a battleground.

02:05:34.569 --> 02:05:36.947
The Army is here trying
to contain the violence

02:05:37.155 --> 02:05:38.702
but clearly, it is outmatched.

02:05:38.948 --> 02:05:41.292
And I have to say,
in all my years of reporting,

02:05:41.367 --> 02:05:44.120
I have never seen anything like this.

02:05:44.454 --> 02:05:45.797
We have limited information
on the team

02:05:46.039 --> 02:05:49.634
but we do know that
billionaire Tony Stark's Iron Man...

02:07:03.199 --> 02:07:05.042
Come on, Stark.

02:07:11.415 --> 02:07:12.587
Close it.

02:07:32.687 --> 02:07:33.688
Son of a gun.

02:07:38.568 --> 02:07:40.241
He's not slowing down.

02:07:58.254 --> 02:07:59.551
Is he breathing?

02:08:27.617 --> 02:08:28.834
What the hell?

02:08:31.746 --> 02:08:33.919
What just happened?

02:08:34.165 --> 02:08:36.293
Please tell me nobody kissed me.

02:08:40.546 --> 02:08:42.014
We won.

02:08:44.550 --> 02:08:45.893
All right, yay!

02:08:45.968 --> 02:08:48.016
Hurray. Good job, guys.

02:08:48.095 --> 02:08:51.065
Let's just not come in tomorrow.
Let's just take a day.

02:08:52.058 --> 02:08:53.480
Have you ever tried shawarma?

02:08:54.143 --> 02:08:56.271
There's a shawarma joint
about two blocks from here.

02:08:56.354 --> 02:08:58.106
I don't know what it is,
but I want to try it.

02:08:58.648 --> 02:08:59.991
We're not finished yet.

02:09:05.071 --> 02:09:06.994
And then shawarma after.

02:09:28.844 --> 02:09:31.188
If it's all the same to you,

02:09:34.392 --> 02:09:36.110
I'll have that drink now.

02:09:43.985 --> 02:09:46.033
Despite the devastation
of what has been confirmed

02:09:46.112 --> 02:09:47.910
as an extraterrestrial attack,

02:09:47.989 --> 02:09:49.536
the extraordinary heroics

02:09:49.657 --> 02:09:51.625
of the group known as the Avengers

02:09:51.701 --> 02:09:53.294
has been to many a cause
not only for comfort,

02:09:53.369 --> 02:09:54.370
but for celebration.

02:09:54.495 --> 02:09:56.964
It's just really great knowing
they're out there.

02:09:57.039 --> 02:09:58.916
That someone is watching over us.

02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:00.252
I love you, Thor!

02:10:00.334 --> 02:10:02.086
And then these guys were like...

02:10:02.169 --> 02:10:03.512
And then the air goes...

02:10:03.587 --> 02:10:05.009
And this green guy walks up
and he goes...

02:10:05.089 --> 02:10:06.181
I don't know.

02:10:06.257 --> 02:10:08.806
I don't exactly feel safer
with those things out there.

02:10:08.884 --> 02:10:11.979
It just seems that there's
a lot they're not telling us.

02:10:12.054 --> 02:10:15.308
Superheroes in New York?
Give me a break.

02:10:15.599 --> 02:10:17.567
These so-called "heroes"

02:10:17.643 --> 02:10:18.986
have to be held responsible

02:10:19.061 --> 02:10:21.314
for the destruction done to this city.

02:10:21.397 --> 02:10:23.525
This was their fight.
Where are they now?

02:10:23.607 --> 02:10:26.486
Tough questions are being asked
about the Avengers themselves.

02:10:26.569 --> 02:10:27.661
Their sudden appearance

02:10:27.737 --> 02:10:29.159
and equally sudden disappearance...

02:10:29.238 --> 02:10:32.082
What, this is all somehow their fault?

02:10:34.076 --> 02:10:37.250
Captain America saved my life.

02:10:39.373 --> 02:10:42.877
Wherever he is, and
wherever any of them are,

02:10:42.960 --> 02:10:44.507
I would just...

02:10:45.254 --> 02:10:47.598
I would want to say thank you.

02:10:50.051 --> 02:10:51.598
Where are the Avengers?

02:10:51.927 --> 02:10:54.100
I'm not currently
tracking their whereabouts.

02:10:54.180 --> 02:10:56.399
I'd say they've earned
a leave of absence.

02:10:56.474 --> 02:10:58.101
And the Tesseract?

02:10:58.184 --> 02:11:00.278
The Tesseract is where it belongs.

02:11:00.895 --> 02:11:03.273
Out of our reach.

02:11:03.481 --> 02:11:04.903
That's not your call.

02:11:04.982 --> 02:11:06.029
I didn't make it.

02:11:06.150 --> 02:11:08.244
I just didn't argue with the god that did.

02:11:08.527 --> 02:11:10.200
So, you let him take it

02:11:10.446 --> 02:11:12.119
and the war criminal, Loki,

02:11:12.198 --> 02:11:13.996
who should be
answering for his crime.

02:11:14.075 --> 02:11:16.419
I think he will be.

02:11:30.132 --> 02:11:32.510
I don't think you understand
what you've started,

02:11:32.885 --> 02:11:35.183
letting the Avengers
loose on this world.

02:11:35.596 --> 02:11:36.643
They're dangerous.

02:11:37.014 --> 02:11:40.518
They surely are,
and the whole world knows it.

02:11:41.227 --> 02:11:43.571
Every world knows it.

02:11:44.230 --> 02:11:46.198
Was that the point of all this?

02:11:46.482 --> 02:11:48.029
A statement?

02:11:50.903 --> 02:11:52.405
A promise.

02:12:00.871 --> 02:12:02.464
Sir, how does it work now?

02:12:03.749 --> 02:12:05.797
They've gone their separate ways.

02:12:05.876 --> 02:12:08.846
Some, pretty extremely far.

02:12:09.547 --> 02:12:11.549
If we get into a situation like this again,

02:12:11.632 --> 02:12:12.975
what happens then?

02:12:13.050 --> 02:12:14.097
They'll come back.

02:12:15.761 --> 02:12:17.263
Are you really sure about that?

02:12:17.346 --> 02:12:18.347
I am.

02:12:20.224 --> 02:12:21.521
Why?

02:12:22.518 --> 02:12:24.395
Because we'll need them to.

02:15:16.275 --> 02:15:18.824
Humans.

02:15:20.029 --> 02:15:24.455
They are not the cowering
wretches we were promised.

02:15:25.367 --> 02:15:27.540
They stand.

02:15:28.370 --> 02:15:33.592
They are unruly,
and therefore cannot be ruled.

02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:44.724
To challenge them

02:15:44.803 --> 02:15:48.182
is to court death.

02:15:49.000 --> 02:16:52.116
