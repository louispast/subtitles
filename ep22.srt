and I am the fastest man alive.

When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10,969 --> 00:00:13,347
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14,181 --> 00:00:16,517
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:21,021 --> 00:00:25,526
But secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:30,197
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

And he kills me.

If this is Dr. Wells, then who
have we been working for this whole time?

18

A completely different person.

that define your life.

All of that vanished.

Would you simply accept your new life
and continue on...

31

Or would you do whatever it takes...

00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:52,816
Why would Wells pretend
to need a wheelchair?

57
00:03:52,983 --> 00:03:55,068
- Sympathy.
- That's what I thought at first.

He's much smarter than that.

Sympathy can't be the only reason.

I mean, the last person we'd suspect
to be the man in yellow...

62

- Is someone who lost the use of their legs.
- Exactly right, Joe.

Which is why I started messing around
with the wheelchair.

anywhere on this thing?

163
00:11:19,888 --> 00:11:22,307
Dude, this thing is from the future.

164
00:11:22,473 --> 00:11:26,102
It's beyond me.
[Press or touch or cut the wrong thing...

165
00:11:26,269 --> 00:11:27,979
I could bring the building down.

166
00:11:28,146 --> 00:11:30,440
Okay, how long until it's fully functional?

167
00:11:31,524 --> 00:11:34,027
Best I can tell, 36 hours.

168
00:11:34,819 --> 00:11:36,362
That's when Wells will be back.

169
00:11:36,529 --> 00:11:39,324
Why would Wells want
the particle accelerator to work again?

170
00:11:39,949 --> 00:11:42,785
I don't know. It's not like it
was a success the first time.

171
00:11:43,161 --> 00:11:46,873
- It made me the flash.
- That's not all it did.

172
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:50,418
Caitlin: So, what happens
if the particle accelerator turns on...

173
00:11:50,585 --> 00:11:52,629
While the metahumans are in containment?

174
00:11:52,837 --> 00:11:53,963
They're toast.

175
00:11:54,130 --> 00:11:57,091
We put them there. Now their
lives are in danger because of us.

176
00:11:57,258 --> 00:12:00,678
Look, I think you all know I've never been
a fan of this arrangement here.

177
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:05,016
I thought the whole plan
was to rehabilitate them and set them free.

178
00:12:05,183 --> 00:12:07,727
It was. We've been a little busy.

179
00:12:08,311 --> 00:12:12,190
Well, if they stay in there, they die. And
if we let them go, they destroy the city.

180
00:12:12,690 --> 00:12:15,318
- We're gonna have to move them.
- Move them where?

181
00:12:15,485 --> 00:12:18,112
- Iron heights can't handle metahumans.
- You're right.

182
00:12:18,279 --> 00:12:19,530
But lian yu can.

183
00:12:21,074 --> 00:12:22,492
What the hell's a lian yu?

184
00:12:22,659 --> 00:12:25,536
Lian yu's the island where Oliver
was stranded for five years.

185
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,914
A.r.g.u.s. Built a
covert military prison on it.

186
00:12:28,122 --> 00:12:29,832
It's where we sent captain boomerang.

187
00:12:29,999 --> 00:12:33,253
Oliver keeps his worst criminals there.
They won't be able to escape.

188
00:12:33,419 --> 00:12:35,421
More importantly, they won't hurt anybody.

189
00:12:37,006 --> 00:12:40,176
So we ship them
from one illegal black site to another.

190
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,263
Yeah, I guess so. Yes.

191
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:47,350
How do we move them
to Oliver's own private Alcatraz?

192
00:12:47,558 --> 00:12:49,310
I'll call him. Maybe he can help.

193
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:53,356
And, Cisco, if we do this,
nobody can get loose.

194
00:12:54,065 --> 00:12:56,192
I might have a way
of getting them out safely.

195
00:12:56,401 --> 00:12:57,860
All right, get on it.

196
00:12:58,027 --> 00:13:00,196
Bar, this is insane.

197
00:13:00,363 --> 00:13:01,614
Joe, we have to do this.

198
00:13:01,990 --> 00:13:05,660
You don't think that if we start bussing
supervillains through downtown...

199
00:13:05,827 --> 00:13:07,036
Nobody's gonna notice?

200
00:13:07,203 --> 00:13:09,580
Oh, they'll notice.
That's where you'll come in.

201
00:13:14,627 --> 00:13:16,421
Cecile.

202
00:13:17,171 --> 00:13:19,716
Aw. Mwah. How's my favorite da?

203
00:13:19,882 --> 00:13:23,469
- Thanks for stopping by.
- Hey, anything for my favorite detective.

204
00:13:26,556 --> 00:13:31,144
Hey. So, what can I do for you?
You sounded a little cryptic on the phone.

205
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,647
Yeah, I wanted your opinion on something.

206
00:13:34,814 --> 00:13:38,026
These people with powers?
The metahumans?

207
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:41,154
Is that what they're calling them?
People love their labels.

208
00:13:41,321 --> 00:13:47,076
Yeah. So let's say, hypothetically,
I know a prison, of sorts.

209
00:13:47,243 --> 00:13:49,746
A place that can do
what iron heights can't...

210
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,623
Where these metahumans, the bad ones...

211
00:13:53,124 --> 00:13:55,251
Are being locked up.

212
00:13:56,336 --> 00:13:57,754
I'd be very concerned.

213
00:13:58,463 --> 00:14:01,841
Especially if, hypothetically,
you had anything to do with it.

214
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,719
Why are you asking me about this?

215
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,680
Well, because Singh's on his honeymoon...

216
00:14:07,847 --> 00:14:11,392
And you're the only other person
I can trust to know this.

217
00:14:13,436 --> 00:14:15,563
Okay, what are you asking me to do?

218
00:14:15,730 --> 00:14:19,108
I need to clear a route through the city.

219
00:14:19,275 --> 00:14:23,237
- Barricades, police cars. The works.
- What am I to tell people? President's in town?

220
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:26,699
- I don't know. You think they'll believe you?
- No, Joe. They wouldn't.

221
00:14:27,575 --> 00:14:31,204
What you're doing, it's called unlawful
imprisonment and human smuggling.

222
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,206
Joe, those are very bad things.

223
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:37,085
These are some bad people, cecile.

224
00:14:37,251 --> 00:14:39,128
But their lives are in danger.

225
00:14:39,796 --> 00:14:42,757
I can't. I can't get involved in this, Joe.
I can't.

226
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:50,056
And as your friend, and possibly the attorney
who will one day be prosecuting you...

227
00:14:50,515 --> 00:14:53,768
I am telling you,
get as far away from this as possible.

228
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:08,282
Okay, so a.R.G.U.S. Has a transport plane
that can take the metahumans to lian yu.

229
00:15:08,449 --> 00:15:11,661
- We need to get them to Ferris airfield.
- Oliver queen came through.

230
00:15:12,036 --> 00:15:14,956
No, actually. It was not him.
Apparently he's in nanda parbat.

231
00:15:15,415 --> 00:15:17,417
- What?
- Wherever that is. I don't know.

232
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,419
I called Lyla, diggle's wife.

233
00:15:19,585 --> 00:15:21,796
She's gonna hook us up.

234
00:15:21,963 --> 00:15:24,215
So, what about c.C.P.D.
Giving us an escort?

235
00:15:24,632 --> 00:15:27,427
Man, it ain't happening.
You saw me talking to the da.

236
00:15:27,593 --> 00:15:29,095
She was very clear.

237
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:32,432
I could lose my badge. I could go to jail.
We could go to jail.

238
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,809
We are protecting people.

239
00:15:34,976 --> 00:15:39,772
We are, Barry, but I'm a cop. There's
a certain set of rules I need to follow.

240
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,483
And this year, I broke all of them.
Lying to my boss...

241
00:15:42,650 --> 00:15:44,861
- I know.
- Ignoring the law.

242
00:15:45,027 --> 00:15:48,364
At what point do we become no different
than the people we're fighting?

243
00:15:48,531 --> 00:15:50,032
- We are way different.
- How?

244
00:15:50,241 --> 00:15:52,785
We only break the rules to help people.

245
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,838
Snart: Give me another one.

246
00:16:04,380 --> 00:16:05,756
Ice cold.

247
00:16:12,638 --> 00:16:14,765
Well, well, well.

248

If it isn't the Scarlet speedster.

249
00:16:28,029 --> 00:16:30,448
You want anything? Beer? Food?

250
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:33,409
Pickled eggs here are fantastic.

251
00:16:33,576 --> 00:16:36,287
No, I'm good.
I need your help with a problem.

252
00:16:36,454 --> 00:16:40,750
Must be pretty desperate to come
asking for my assistance, but I'll bite.

253
00:16:40,917 --> 00:16:42,084
What do you need?

254
00:16:42,251 --> 00:16:44,587
Help transporting
some people out of the city.

255
00:16:44,754 --> 00:16:45,838
How many?

256
00:16:46,005 --> 00:16:47,882
Five.

257
00:16:48,049 --> 00:16:52,261
Five very bad, very angry people...

258
00:16:52,762 --> 00:16:53,930
Who have powers.

259
00:16:54,597 --> 00:16:56,140
Powers, hmm?

260
00:16:56,307 --> 00:16:58,768
So you want me to, what,
freeze the problem?

261
00:16:58,935 --> 00:17:01,604
Protect you from them
if anything goes wrong?

262
00:17:03,272 --> 00:17:07,151
First rule of business,
always protect yourself.

263
00:17:07,318 --> 00:17:10,112
I'm not gonna help
Usher your enemies out of town.

264
00:17:10,321 --> 00:17:12,448
They're not just my enemies.
They're yours too.

265
00:17:16,911 --> 00:17:19,372
They will destroy central city.

266
00:17:19,539 --> 00:17:21,374
It's not my problem.

267
00:17:21,541 --> 00:17:23,668
You said you love it
here. That this is home.

268
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:25,211
I do, and it is.

269
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:26,796
Well, guess what.

270
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:30,633
These people get loose,
there won't be a city to love anymore.

271
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:34,554
You won't be able to Rob anyone
if everybody's dead.

272
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,684
It's a compelling argument.

273
00:17:40,309 --> 00:17:42,645
If I'm gonna help you out...

274
00:17:44,647 --> 00:17:47,567
I'll need something in return.

275
00:17:48,317 --> 00:17:49,986
- Like what?
- This.

276

[Scoffs]

277
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:58,077
No. This is impossible. I can't do that.

278
00:17:58,244 --> 00:18:00,621
- Then I can't help you.
- There has to...

279
00:18:01,664 --> 00:18:04,875
Snart, there has to be something you want
that I can get.

280
00:18:08,170 --> 00:18:09,297
Let me think about it.

281

[On jukebox]
You're as cold as ice, I know

282
00:18:13,134 --> 00:18:15,011
you're as cold as ice

283
00:18:19,724 --> 00:18:21,225
Iris: Eddie.

284
00:18:21,684 --> 00:18:23,311
- Hey.
- Where have you been?

285
00:18:24,186 --> 00:18:25,521
Here, work.

286
00:18:25,688 --> 00:18:29,191
You were kidnapped for two weeks, and
your first thought is to go back to work?

287
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,028
I just needed something
constant in my life.

288
00:18:32,194 --> 00:18:33,404
I thought that was us.

289
00:18:33,863 --> 00:18:35,865
Eddie, I miss you.

290
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:38,367
I love you. Hey.

291
00:18:39,243 --> 00:18:42,622
I saw this when we found you.

292
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:46,208
This was for me, wasn't it?
When you took me to the waterfront...

293
00:18:46,375 --> 00:18:49,337
And Dr. Wells abducted you,
you were going to propose.

294
00:18:50,046 --> 00:18:51,505
I was.

295
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,257
But now you're not?

296
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:56,719
What did he do to you?

297
00:18:58,554 --> 00:19:02,391
He didn't do anything to me, Iris.
It's what he showed me.

298
00:19:02,558 --> 00:19:05,561
What could he have shown you
that would make you change your mind?

299
00:19:05,728 --> 00:19:07,229
The future.

300
00:19:07,772 --> 00:19:10,191
He showed me the future, Iris.

301
00:19:10,566 --> 00:19:11,942
We don't get married.

302
00:19:12,735 --> 00:19:14,236
You and Barry do.

303
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:16,781
I gotta go.

304
00:19:23,037 --> 00:19:27,249
Are you out of your mind? What do you mean
you talked to Leonard snart?

305
00:19:27,416 --> 00:19:28,501
I asked him for help.

306
00:19:28,668 --> 00:19:30,544
Why would you do something so stupid?

307
00:19:30,711 --> 00:19:33,089
Because, Joe,
we have already tried everyone else.

308
00:19:33,255 --> 00:19:37,593
Look, you tried the c.C.P.D. I tried
Oliver. I even tried Ronnie and Dr. Stein.

309
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:40,554
- The particle accelerator goes online in...
- Sixteen hours.

310
00:19:40,721 --> 00:19:42,098
16 hours, Joe.

311
00:19:42,765 --> 00:19:46,227
I'm not willing to let the metas die,
and we can't let them escape either.

312
00:19:46,394 --> 00:19:48,854
So like it or not, snart,
with his cold-gun...

313
00:19:49,021 --> 00:19:52,942
Is the only one that can stop them
if Cisco's transportation does not hold.

314
00:19:53,109 --> 00:19:56,779
Then lucky for you,
I figured out what it is you can get me.

Hello, detective. Nice to see you again.

316
00:19:59,281 --> 00:20:01,117
Caitlin, Cisco.

317
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:03,869
I thought about your proposal.

318
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,454
You want my help...

319
00:20:05,830 --> 00:20:07,790
This is what I want.

320
00:20:07,957 --> 00:20:10,042
My fingerprints, dental records...

321
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:12,795
DNA, criminal records, family tree.

322
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:18,092
Everything there is in this world
concerning Leonard snart...

323
00:20:18,259 --> 00:20:20,219
I want it destroyed.

324
00:20:20,386 --> 00:20:21,512
All of it.

325
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,683
At c.C.P.D., online, everywhere.

326
00:20:25,850 --> 00:20:27,309
Joe: The brass on this dude.

327
00:20:27,977 --> 00:20:30,146
You really think we'd do that for you?

328
00:20:32,940 --> 00:20:34,734
If it's the only way, fine.

329
00:20:35,109 --> 00:20:37,653
You and me need to talk right now.

330
00:20:45,369 --> 00:20:48,664
What is wrong with you? You can't
just erase snart's criminal records.

331
00:20:48,831 --> 00:20:51,041
Yeah, I can. And I'll do
whatever I have to do.

332
00:20:51,208 --> 00:20:53,794
- Bar, there's gotta be a different way.
- What is it?

333
00:20:54,128 --> 00:20:57,173
Tell me what it is, and we'll do it.
We're running out of time!

334
00:20:58,758 --> 00:21:00,259
What is going on with you?

335
00:21:01,051 --> 00:21:04,346
You working with that killer?
This isn't who you are.

336
00:21:05,264 --> 00:21:09,226
Who I am is the guy
who's not fast enough to stop Wells.

337
00:21:09,393 --> 00:21:12,354
He hasn't been one step ahead of us, Joe.
He's been a thousand.

338
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:14,315
I can't catch him. I can't beat him.

339
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:17,193
What I can do
is save those people down there.

340
00:21:17,359 --> 00:21:19,195
Wells turned them into what they are...

341
00:21:19,361 --> 00:21:23,407
And I'm pretty sure he does not care
if they live or die. I do.

342
00:21:41,342 --> 00:21:42,551
Bye-bye, Leonard snart.

343
00:21:47,515 --> 00:21:51,560
I've deleted everything the c.C.P.D.,
a.R.G.U.S. And the FBI had on you...

344
00:21:51,727 --> 00:21:55,272
And sent a virus to erase
every digital record of you online.

345
00:21:55,439 --> 00:22:00,110
And this is every single piece
of physical evidence the police had.

346
00:22:08,744 --> 00:22:10,996

to be working together.

You were right, Lenny. She is very uptight.

351
00:22:28,430 --> 00:22:30,224
I am not uptight.

352
00:22:33,060 --> 00:22:34,353
You can't call me uptight.

353

354

We need their help
if we're gonna pull this off.

355

Why are you wearing your mask?
Snart knows who you are.

356
00:22:43,779 --> 00:22:47,533
And I promised I wouldn't tell anyone.
That includes my sister.

- Jerk.
- Train wreck.

Don't look so surprised, detective.
I am a man of my word.

you're on that damn plane too.

Oh, hey, captain cold's evil sister.

Oh. You're not still mad at me, are you?

I really did enjoy kissing you.

You kissed her?

Under duress. Calm down.

00:23:29,909 --> 00:23:31,660
Well, stop.

A girl can hope.

being one of the good guys this week.

-Really not. Flash: Hey, dude.

374
00:23:50,804 --> 00:23:53,891
Have you figured out a way
to get the metahumans to the airport?

375
00:23:54,058 --> 00:23:55,851
I have, actually.

376
00:23:56,018 --> 00:23:57,227
And it's pretty dope.

377
00:23:59,104 --> 00:24:00,731
This is cool. Where'd you get this?

378
00:24:00,898 --> 00:24:05,152
My uncle owns it. His company hauls
frozen food cross-country.

379
00:24:05,361 --> 00:24:09,031
Okay, so I retrofitted the cooling system
with the wheelchair's power source...

380
00:24:09,198 --> 00:24:11,200
To create an energy damper.

381
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:13,410
Which means what, exactly?

382
00:24:13,619 --> 00:24:16,664
The back of this rig is being flooded
with so much power...

383
00:24:16,830 --> 00:24:20,876
It's creating a transient pulse strong
enough to disrupt the metahumans' powers.

384
00:24:21,251 --> 00:24:24,755
We can get them to the airport and
on the plane without them getting fresh.

385
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:29,426
We need somebody with a class a
commercial driver's license to drive this.

386
00:24:29,843 --> 00:24:30,886
I can drive it.
