1
00:00:10,174 --> 00:00:11,842
Anything?

2
00:00:12,136 --> 00:00:14,334
The intel
I intercepted was clear.

3
00:00:14,414 --> 00:00:16,534
The Wrecking Crew,
at these coordinates.

4
00:00:16,614 --> 00:00:19,280
If they don't show up soon,
we're gonna have an all-out war.

5
00:00:19,444 --> 00:00:20,993
Inside the Avenjet.

6
00:00:21,174 --> 00:00:24,531
Time. To. Smash!

7
00:00:39,063 --> 00:00:41,094
You may have
bested me at this,

8
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:43,254
but that was
no true victory.

9
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:44,933
Was that?

10
00:00:47,654 --> 00:00:50,294
Falcon, game of darts?
Arrows versus...

11
00:00:50,374 --> 00:00:52,070
Whatever those things
are you shoot.

12
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:53,184
Flechettes.

13
00:00:53,414 --> 00:00:55,894
I'm finishing up this
electromagnetic particle gun.

14
00:00:55,974 --> 00:00:58,054
"Electromagmata,"
what, now?

15
00:00:58,134 --> 00:01:00,654
It works by magnetically
combining the electron fields

16
00:01:00,734 --> 00:01:02,242
of an ionized...

17
00:01:03,391 --> 00:01:07,376
Oh, I'm sorry. I fell asleep while you
were talking nerd stuff.

18
00:01:07,888 --> 00:01:09,174
We've got visual.

19
00:01:14,534 --> 00:01:17,256
So much for that awesome gear
you promised, Wrecker.

20
00:01:17,336 --> 00:01:19,654
-You got played!
-Wrong.

21
00:01:29,854 --> 00:01:31,734
A.I.M.'s abandoned tech.

22
00:01:32,012 --> 00:01:35,769
-Time for the Wrecking Crew to upgrade.
-Yeah!

23
00:01:40,211 --> 00:01:42,502
-Avengers...
-Smash!

24
00:01:42,854 --> 00:01:45,174
I don't think that's where Cap
was going with that, Hulk.

25
00:01:45,331 --> 00:01:46,934
Tired of waiting.

26
00:01:57,628 --> 00:01:59,614
You think tech will make
you guys better?

27
00:01:59,694 --> 00:02:01,706
Please.
You'll always be a wreck.

28
00:02:01,786 --> 00:02:02,879
It's your name!

29
00:02:10,214 --> 00:02:11,094
Sorry, guys.

30
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,054
Emergency exit only.

31
00:02:23,734 --> 00:02:25,961
Who's the wreck now?

32
00:02:26,254 --> 00:02:27,697
Is this a trick question?

33
00:02:40,487 --> 00:02:43,927
So far, not a big fan
of the Wrecking Crew's upgrade.

34
00:02:49,927 --> 00:02:51,327
Huh?

35
00:02:54,471 --> 00:02:56,579
Hope this doesn't bore you
again, Hawkeye!

36
00:03:09,536 --> 00:03:12,927
Oh, and this? This is my molecular
restraint system.

37
00:03:14,639 --> 00:03:16,199
Nerd stuff.

38
00:03:25,239 --> 00:03:27,767
More fun than thumb wrestling.

39
00:03:27,999 --> 00:03:32,119
Outthinking the enemy
is the first step to outfighting them.

40
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:34,319
Couldn't have done it
better myself.

41
00:03:34,399 --> 00:03:37,719
Okay. I could have, but...
I'm still impressed.

42
00:03:38,069 --> 00:03:38,927
Nothing to say?

43
00:03:39,093 --> 00:03:41,639
Falcon's tech did save
your quiver, after all.

44
00:03:41,719 --> 00:03:43,519
Sure. Yeah. Thanks.

45
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:45,319
You seem to have
your arrows in a knot.

46
00:03:45,588 --> 00:03:47,279
Was saving you the wrong
thing to do or something?

47
00:03:47,589 --> 00:03:50,159
I appreciate the save,
but anyone with that gun

48
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:53,039
could have done the same thing.
A real hero has skills!

49
00:03:53,248 --> 00:03:54,839
My tech is my skill.

50
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:57,039
You think anyone could
just put on this suit and be Falcon?

51
00:03:57,283 --> 00:04:00,146
No, not anyone.
Hulk's way too heavy.

52
00:04:00,399 --> 00:04:01,919
He'd never get airborne.

53
00:04:16,073 --> 00:04:16,999
Hey!

54
00:04:18,973 --> 00:04:21,079
-A little off?
-Thanks to you.

55
00:04:21,318 --> 00:04:23,599
Don't ruin my concentration.
I'm busy.

56
00:04:23,679 --> 00:04:25,839
Some of us need to keep
our skills sharp.

57
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:27,600
I think I can help
with that.

58
00:04:28,236 --> 00:04:30,090
-Not interested.
-Check it.

59
00:04:30,319 --> 00:04:31,916
Never-miss arrows.

60
00:04:32,096 --> 00:04:33,559
Can I borrow that?

61
00:04:33,854 --> 00:04:35,359
Load it into the bow,
like normal.

62
00:04:35,611 --> 00:04:37,840
State your target,
then shoot.

63
00:04:38,061 --> 00:04:39,439
Hulk's sandwich!

64
00:04:41,084 --> 00:04:42,679
Target confirmed.

65
00:04:45,022 --> 00:04:46,357
Hey!

66
00:04:46,437 --> 00:04:48,479
See? Works every time.

67
00:04:49,152 --> 00:04:50,759
Just another toy.

68
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:52,279
That never misses!

69
00:04:52,588 --> 00:04:55,068
There's more to me than
just hitting targets.

70
00:04:55,148 --> 00:04:57,033
You could give those arrows
to everyone on the team,

71
00:04:57,113 --> 00:04:59,308
and they still
wouldn't be Hawkeye.

72
00:05:00,828 --> 00:05:03,268
-Center target.
-Target confirmed.

73
00:05:06,868 --> 00:05:08,468
Any more
brilliant inventions?

74
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,526
One of you is toast!

75
00:05:12,169 --> 00:05:13,428
Never mind.

76
00:05:14,854 --> 00:05:17,738
An electronic shield
that calculates its own flight path.

77
00:05:17,925 --> 00:05:19,348
Target confirmed.

78
00:05:21,308 --> 00:05:23,948
Bet Cap
won't be too impressed.

79
00:05:24,028 --> 00:05:25,156
Energy gloves.

80
00:05:25,419 --> 00:05:27,628
Now Hulk's not the only one
with smashing power.

81
00:05:32,787 --> 00:05:35,708
Trying to mimic
everyone else's powers?

82
00:05:35,984 --> 00:05:37,628
You're just
proving my point.

83
00:05:37,708 --> 00:05:38,974
Okay. What about this?

84
00:05:39,054 --> 00:05:40,748
An Asgardian Runestone.

85
00:05:40,953 --> 00:05:43,388
I'm trying to recreate
Thor's powers.

86
00:05:43,468 --> 00:05:45,348
You just twist this, and...

87
00:05:45,582 --> 00:05:47,148
According to my calculations,

88
00:05:47,228 --> 00:05:49,268
it should do something
like this...

89
00:05:52,956 --> 00:05:54,935
I guess.
What did you just do?

90
00:05:55,209 --> 00:05:57,729
I'm betting you didn't
transport us to Jersey.

91
00:05:57,883 --> 00:06:00,685
Got it under control.
I'll just reverse...

92
00:06:01,049 --> 00:06:03,969
Oh, great. The other half
must still be in the tower.

93
00:06:07,529 --> 00:06:09,418
You're right.
This sure isn't Jersey.

94
00:06:19,369 --> 00:06:20,529
I got this!

95
00:06:29,393 --> 00:06:30,769
Huh?

96
00:06:32,409 --> 00:06:34,369
My suit. It's shorted out!

97
00:06:43,489 --> 00:06:44,413
All my gear!

98
00:06:44,493 --> 00:06:46,593
That creature
shorted it out.

99
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:49,540
I don't think we're going to find you
an electrical outlet here.

100
00:06:55,853 --> 00:06:59,253
You strangers dare come to Vanaheim
with electric machines?

101
00:06:59,516 --> 00:07:01,633
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
We didn't dare anything.

102
00:07:01,713 --> 00:07:04,793
Genius here accidentally
teleported us from Earth to...

103
00:07:04,873 --> 00:07:06,954
Where'd you say?
Vanaheim?

104
00:07:07,034 --> 00:07:08,353
Does that happen
to be in Jersey?

105
00:07:08,433 --> 00:07:09,553
All right, look. I'm Falcon,

106
00:07:09,633 --> 00:07:11,393
and this charming guy
is Hawkeye.

107
00:07:11,473 --> 00:07:13,153
And what's wrong
with our electricity?

108
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:15,993
Them. The Shadow Nixes
feed off of it.

109
00:07:16,073 --> 00:07:18,073
Our realm has
banished such things.

110
00:07:18,153 --> 00:07:20,233
Oh, you are gonna
love it here.

111
00:07:20,313 --> 00:07:23,713
The Shadow Nixes have grown more
bold since the Great Light burned out.

112
00:07:23,887 --> 00:07:26,513
And I was unable to find
more potion to fuel it.

113
00:07:26,593 --> 00:07:29,187
Wasn't she speaking English
just a second ago?

114
00:07:29,267 --> 00:07:31,262
Wait, "potion"?
"Great Light"?

115
00:07:31,342 --> 00:07:33,981
So, you don't have technology,
you have...

116
00:07:34,168 --> 00:07:34,839
Magic.

117
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:36,193
Hurry! We have no time!

118
00:07:37,268 --> 00:07:39,353
No tech. Magic!

119
00:07:39,433 --> 00:07:42,574
-I've never felt more useless.
-I got a use for you.

120
00:07:42,654 --> 00:07:44,873
Figure out how to get us
out of the Hundred Acre Wood,

121
00:07:44,953 --> 00:07:48,566
and back to New York with all its
glorious streetlights and power sockets.

122
00:07:48,733 --> 00:07:50,518
Not without the rest
of the Runestone.

123
00:07:50,663 --> 00:07:53,257
Someone back at the tower
has to fire it up to bring us back.

124
00:07:53,433 --> 00:07:56,233
Great! This trip keeps
getting better and better.

125
00:08:02,979 --> 00:08:04,793
Oh, no! My village!

126
00:08:11,193 --> 00:08:13,513
One, two, three!

127
00:08:15,430 --> 00:08:16,811
You must declare me

128
00:08:16,891 --> 00:08:19,056
Master of the Wrestling
of Thumbs.

129
00:08:19,249 --> 00:08:20,530
Never!

130
00:08:21,353 --> 00:08:22,473
The winner of the next round

131
00:08:22,553 --> 00:08:24,873
takes on both
of the newcomers.

132
00:08:24,953 --> 00:08:27,273
Uh, no, thanks. I'm actually
going horseback riding.

133
00:08:27,491 --> 00:08:29,073
The police let me ride
with their horse trainer.

134
00:08:29,153 --> 00:08:32,362
-Anyone want to come along?
-Do I look like I ride horses?

135
00:08:34,874 --> 00:08:36,873
-Huh?
-So much for a day off.

136
00:08:36,953 --> 00:08:38,306
Who invited these things?

137
00:08:42,103 --> 00:08:42,713
Hey.

138
00:08:42,793 --> 00:08:44,629
I do the smashing
around here!

139
00:08:44,809 --> 00:08:46,273
Incoming!

140
00:08:54,461 --> 00:08:56,578
Looks like they
drain electricity!

141
00:08:56,717 --> 00:09:00,073
Of course they do!
They're Shadow Nixes from Vanaheim!

142
00:09:00,153 --> 00:09:02,873
More intel, please.
What's a Shadow Nix?

143
00:09:02,953 --> 00:09:05,233
Mystical creatures
that feed on electricity.

144
00:09:05,313 --> 00:09:07,473
How these two got here,
I've no idea.

145
00:09:07,553 --> 00:09:10,892
If we don't stop them,
they'll send Earth into the Stone Age.

146
00:09:10,972 --> 00:09:13,553
Magic isn't real, Thor.
I'm not buyin' it!

147
00:09:22,153 --> 00:09:24,356
I'd say you just bought it.

148
00:09:24,543 --> 00:09:26,833
No tech?
Let's do this old school!

149
00:09:40,252 --> 00:09:42,313
Neat trick!
Got anything else?

150
00:09:50,233 --> 00:09:53,393
Still... Not... Impressed.

151
00:10:09,073 --> 00:10:12,493
We have to herd these
creatures back to Vanaheim.

152
00:10:12,984 --> 00:10:15,673
I should really start
carrying a can opener with me.

153
00:10:15,753 --> 00:10:17,873
Very funny.
You stop those Nixes,

154
00:10:17,953 --> 00:10:19,951
and I'm gonna figure out
how our power-hungry friends

155
00:10:20,031 --> 00:10:21,494
got here in the first place.

156
00:10:39,143 --> 00:10:40,633
-Excuse us. Pardon me.
-Out of my way. Watch your back

157
00:10:40,713 --> 00:10:41,752
Coming through.

158
00:10:44,553 --> 00:10:47,353
My village can't stop them
without the Great Light!

159
00:10:47,433 --> 00:10:51,233
Who needs a "Great Light"
when you've got all this stuff and me?

160
00:10:55,438 --> 00:10:57,153
I'm starting
to like this place!

161
00:10:58,599 --> 00:11:01,753
-Whoa.
-Just usin' my skills, Falcon.

162
00:11:06,294 --> 00:11:08,913
I've never seen our weapons
used that way.

163
00:11:10,769 --> 00:11:12,633
You're not the only one
with skills!

164
00:11:19,348 --> 00:11:20,873
Get these villagers inside!

165
00:11:20,953 --> 00:11:22,833
I got this!

166
00:11:28,709 --> 00:11:30,553
Lady Freya. The potion!

167
00:11:30,633 --> 00:11:32,260
There is none, Elder Lorak.

168
00:11:32,340 --> 00:11:33,969
My mission was a failure.

169
00:11:34,218 --> 00:11:35,713
Then we truly are doomed.

170
00:11:35,793 --> 00:11:37,673
What exactly is this
"Great Light"?

171
00:11:37,753 --> 00:11:40,673
It's been lit for centuries,
keeping the Shadow Nixes at bay.

172
00:11:40,753 --> 00:11:42,513
It has never
gone out before.

173
00:11:42,593 --> 00:11:45,073
And you can't re-light it
without this magic potion?

174
00:11:45,913 --> 00:11:47,033
I need some more data.

175
00:11:48,389 --> 00:11:51,218
Information. Anything
you have on the Great Light.

176
00:11:51,913 --> 00:11:53,633
These are the spells
that illuminate it,

177
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:55,342
but this language is ancient,

178
00:11:55,422 --> 00:11:57,353
and none of us
can understand it.

179
00:11:57,433 --> 00:11:59,393
Close the gates!

180
00:11:59,473 --> 00:12:01,713
You're about to have some
unwanted house guests!

181
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:06,798
Please tell me your village
has an escape tunnel or something?

182
00:12:06,878 --> 00:12:08,681
The Nixes will not stop
with the village!

183
00:12:08,761 --> 00:12:09,674
Without the Great Light,

184
00:12:09,754 --> 00:12:12,348
-they will take over this entire realm!
-Hmm.

185
00:12:13,151 --> 00:12:15,118
Jarvis, can you hear me?

186
00:12:15,198 --> 00:12:17,019
And of course not.

187
00:12:17,289 --> 00:12:19,725
No power, no Jarvis.

188
00:12:20,167 --> 00:12:23,358
Hawkeye! Falcon! You guys
taking a vacation or something?

189
00:12:26,159 --> 00:12:28,158
Now, where did those
two uglies come from?

190
00:12:33,314 --> 00:12:37,678
For creatures that feed on power,
New York is a glorious feast!

191
00:12:54,438 --> 00:12:56,438
Hey, I was watchin' that!

192
00:13:00,638 --> 00:13:02,158
Here's Hulk in your eye!

193
00:13:06,415 --> 00:13:07,708
Where are ya?

194
00:13:12,318 --> 00:13:14,078
Watch your step, ma'am.

195
00:13:27,604 --> 00:13:28,518
Fun!

196
00:13:35,332 --> 00:13:37,278
And don't come back!

197
00:13:37,358 --> 00:13:38,763
You're not that scary, Hulk.

198
00:13:38,843 --> 00:13:40,198
They're going after something.

199
00:13:40,859 --> 00:13:42,617
I am too that scary.

200
00:13:51,507 --> 00:13:53,397
They're headed
for the power plant.

201
00:13:53,618 --> 00:13:55,558
First Jersey, then the world.

202
00:14:07,103 --> 00:14:09,670
If the Nixes reach their
upper limit of power,

203
00:14:09,750 --> 00:14:11,274
they will be unstoppable.

204
00:14:11,354 --> 00:14:15,998
Centuries ago, they nearly
wiped Vanaheim from the Nine Realms.

205
00:14:18,495 --> 00:14:21,055
Their appetite is voracious.
Know the feeling.

206
00:14:31,305 --> 00:14:32,855
Move, move, move!

207
00:14:35,358 --> 00:14:37,335
Huh. Nothing like
a little improvisation.

208
00:14:37,415 --> 00:14:39,335
Why does your partner
not help?

209
00:14:39,415 --> 00:14:41,750
Falcon? Not much
he can do without tech.

210
00:14:41,830 --> 00:14:43,295
He's probably taking a nap.

211
00:14:47,295 --> 00:14:49,055
-Will these do?
-Awesome!

212
00:14:49,135 --> 00:14:51,535
I still need three ounces
of calcium carbonate.

213
00:14:53,264 --> 00:14:55,655
I mean, grab me
a chunk of limestone.

214
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:05,495
Now, if I were the key to sending
energy-hungry creatures

215
00:15:05,575 --> 00:15:08,375
back to an Asgardian realm,
where would I be?

216
00:15:12,695 --> 00:15:15,655
What do I always say about
playing with Thor's toys?

217
00:15:23,295 --> 00:15:25,495
Don't these things
ever get tired?

218
00:15:32,535 --> 00:15:34,495
Come on!
That was brand new!

219
00:15:42,815 --> 00:15:44,775
Falcon?

220
00:15:55,575 --> 00:15:58,206
You got your net arrows,
some flame arrows...

221
00:15:58,286 --> 00:16:00,489
Oh and be careful
with the goo arrows.

222
00:16:00,569 --> 00:16:02,370
Stickiest tree sap
I've ever seen.

223
00:16:02,450 --> 00:16:04,792
Wait. You made all this?

224
00:16:04,872 --> 00:16:07,241
-Just usin' my skills, Hawkeye.
-Touche.

225
00:16:25,929 --> 00:16:28,255
Of course you know
how to ride a horse.

226
00:16:28,335 --> 00:16:31,135
I didn't spend a month training with
the cavalry for nothing.

227
00:16:31,215 --> 00:16:32,655
Looks like Falcon and Hawkeye

228
00:16:32,735 --> 00:16:34,383
broke a Runestone
from Asgard.

229
00:16:34,463 --> 00:16:35,884
I'm guessing it switched them

230
00:16:35,964 --> 00:16:37,815
with these Nixes
from Vanaheim.

231
00:16:37,895 --> 00:16:39,662
Can you Pony Express
this thing?

232
00:16:39,883 --> 00:16:42,630
Snowball's not a pony.
He's a stallion.

233
00:16:48,815 --> 00:16:51,355
Hey! Big guy!
Yeah, you!

234
00:16:51,435 --> 00:16:53,147
Over here! Yeah!

235
00:16:53,365 --> 00:16:55,565
Bring your friends, too!

236
00:16:55,962 --> 00:16:58,605
Uh, I never voted
for this plan.

237
00:17:01,102 --> 00:17:03,302
Your turn, kids!
Just like we practiced!

238
00:17:07,939 --> 00:17:09,982
Just a little sulfur
compound I whipped up. Ugh!

239
00:17:10,271 --> 00:17:11,102
Kids love it.

240
00:17:23,058 --> 00:17:26,095
Thor! Hawkeye and Falcon brought
these things here with your Runestone.

241
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,402
Can you reverse it?

242
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:31,782
Aye! And I clearly need
to lock the door to my quarters.

243
00:17:37,988 --> 00:17:41,502
All the gooey arrows in the world
aren't going to replace that Great Light.

244
00:17:41,582 --> 00:17:43,902
Right. Should be ready.

245
00:17:43,982 --> 00:17:46,782
Wait. You managed
to master magic, too?

246
00:17:46,862 --> 00:17:49,262
Magic's just technology
we don't understand.

247
00:17:49,342 --> 00:17:51,142
The potion's
a chemical solution.

248
00:17:51,222 --> 00:17:53,506
I took ten parts magnesium
and let it...

249
00:17:53,686 --> 00:17:54,342
Wait.

250
00:17:54,689 --> 00:17:56,742
Nerd stuff.
I don't want to bore you.

251
00:17:56,822 --> 00:17:58,627
No, not bored, just...

252
00:17:58,822 --> 00:18:00,382
Way over my head.

253
00:18:01,302 --> 00:18:03,422
They've activated
the Runestone from Earth!

254
00:18:03,502 --> 00:18:05,502
Perfect timing as always.

255
00:18:07,582 --> 00:18:10,302
-A little teamwork?
-I like your thinking.

256
00:18:29,071 --> 00:18:31,147
The Great Light
burns once again!

257
00:18:31,227 --> 00:18:32,960
Thank you, heroes.

258
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:36,702
Let us always remember
in myth, legend and song

259
00:18:36,848 --> 00:18:40,582
the great Falcon and his
trusty sidekick, Hawkeye!

260
00:18:40,662 --> 00:18:42,319
Yeah.
Wait, wait, wait. What?

261
00:18:45,422 --> 00:18:47,812
Now we really are in Jersey?

262
00:18:50,745 --> 00:18:53,050
It failed to
transport them back!

263
00:18:53,354 --> 00:18:56,018
The Shadow Nixes have
grown too powerful!

264
00:18:56,813 --> 00:18:58,973
Any bright ideas,
hero of Vanaheim?

265
00:18:59,053 --> 00:19:00,822
Yes! Literally.

266
00:19:04,397 --> 00:19:05,502
Thor!

267
00:19:08,222 --> 00:19:10,258
How did you obtain
a Great Light?

268
00:19:10,338 --> 00:19:13,102
Long story. I need
some amplification.

269
00:19:28,742 --> 00:19:29,902
Skills.

270
00:19:33,677 --> 00:19:37,378
Let's see how hungry you are
for the power of the Nine Realms!

271
00:20:04,800 --> 00:20:08,062
On it!
Twelve o'clock! Heads up!

272
00:20:10,043 --> 00:20:11,857
Watch your back!
On your right!

273
00:20:11,937 --> 00:20:14,195
On your left!

274
00:20:14,448 --> 00:20:17,248
-Well-played.
-Workin' on my skills.

275
00:20:17,328 --> 00:20:20,168
Getting caught in Vanaheim
without my gear was a wakeup call.

276
00:20:22,619 --> 00:20:24,064
I couldn't have been
more wrong.

277
00:20:24,144 --> 00:20:26,019
I thought your strength
was only in your tech.

278
00:20:26,099 --> 00:20:28,219
But your tech just
shows your real skill,

279
00:20:28,384 --> 00:20:30,219
recognizing
and solving problems.

280
00:20:30,535 --> 00:20:32,699
Which is kind of heroic,
right?

281
00:20:32,779 --> 00:20:34,521
Heads up!

282
00:20:34,939 --> 00:20:36,459
From you, that's high praise.

283
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,419
Yeah.
Don't get used to it.
