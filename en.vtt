00:00:02.085 --> 00:00:06.798
Barry: My name is Barry Allen
and I am the fastest man alive.

2
00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:10.761
When I was a child, I saw my mother killed
by something impossible.

3
00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:13.347
My father went to prison for her murder.

4
00:00:14.181 --> 00:00:16.558
Then an accident
made me the impossible.

5
00:00:18.101 --> 00:00:20.771
To the outside world,
I'm an ordinary forensic scientist...

6
00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:25.484
But secretly, I use my speed to
fight crime and find others like me.

7
00:00:25.692 --> 00:00:30.155
And one day, I'll find who killed my mother
and get justice for my father.

8
00:00:30.364 --> 00:00:32.157
I am the flash.

9
00:00:32.866 --> 00:00:34.135
Narrator:
Previously on the flash:

10
00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:36.036
- Eddie: Iris west.
- Eddie?

11
00:00:39.581 --> 00:00:43.335
- The man in the yellow, he took Eddie.
- I promise I will find him, okay?

12
00:00:45.837 --> 00:00:47.381
Barry.

13
00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:50.634
Iris:
Think about your best friend.

14
00:00:50.801 --> 00:00:54.012
It could be your wife, your father,
maybe someone you grew up with.

15
00:00:54.805 --> 00:00:58.308
It's the person you can't wait to talk to
at the end of the day.

16
00:00:58.475 --> 00:01:01.687
The person who knows everything about you,
who roots for you.

17
00:01:02.312 --> 00:01:05.107
Now imagine you discover
your best friend has a secret.

18
00:01:05.357 --> 00:01:08.610
No, not a secret. A universe of secrets.

19
00:01:08.777 --> 00:01:11.989
Would you confront him?
Would you stay silent?

20
00:01:12.197 --> 00:01:15.659
Either way, you know nothing
will ever be the same again.

21
00:01:21.123 --> 00:01:22.291
Where is Thawne?

22
00:01:23.083 --> 00:01:24.626
He took some personal time.

23
00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:27.379
Yeah, uh, Eddie's been
going through some stuff, captain.

24
00:01:27.588 --> 00:01:31.049
Yeah, aren't we all?
Got anything on these gold-store robberies?

25
00:01:31.258 --> 00:01:33.802
Perps hit two more in the last week
and we got nothing.

26
00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:36.597
- We're working on it.
- Waiting on results from the lab.

27
00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:37.848
Pick up the pace.

28
00:01:38.056 --> 00:01:41.727
And see if somebody can contact the flash,
maybe he can help speed things up.

29
00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:43.854
You know what I mean. Get going.

30
00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:49.484
- Anything?
- No. I mean, I've looked everywhere.

31
00:01:50.402 --> 00:01:51.445
[Groans]

32
00:01:51.612 --> 00:01:53.196
Keep looking.

33
00:01:53.405 --> 00:01:54.740
Of course, yeah.

34
00:01:58.869 --> 00:01:59.995
Hey.

35
00:02:00.912 --> 00:02:01.955
Hey.

36
00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:05.250
- Uh, I'm heading out right now. What's up?
- Something happened.

37
00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.046
And I'm not supposed to say anything,
but I couldn't keep quiet.

38
00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:10.589
What happened?

39
00:02:10.797 --> 00:02:13.967
The man in yellow,
he took Eddie right in front of me.

40
00:02:14.176 --> 00:02:15.302
Oh, my god.

41
00:02:17.763 --> 00:02:20.557
- Are you okay? Wha...?
- No. No, not at all.

42
00:02:20.766 --> 00:02:22.476
- No, I...
- The flash was there.

43
00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:26.188
He told me to go home and not to talk to
anyone because he would fix it, but he hasn't.

44
00:02:26.855 --> 00:02:29.399
I think the police should be out
searching for Eddie.

45
00:02:29.608 --> 00:02:31.818
- No, Iris, I...
- My dad needs to know the truth.

46
00:02:33.236 --> 00:02:35.155
I think that...

47
00:02:35.364 --> 00:02:36.990
The flash is right.

48
00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:41.036
Joe and the cops, they're no
match for the man in yellow, Iris.

49
00:02:41.244 --> 00:02:42.496
They would just get hurt.

50
00:02:42.788 --> 00:02:47.376
So you think the flash is out there,
right now, searching for Eddie?

51
00:02:48.085 --> 00:02:52.839
I'm sure he's doing everything he can
to find him.

52
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:58.679
Yeah, well, I'm finding it pretty hard
to trust the flash right now.

53
00:03:00.263 --> 00:03:02.766
Well then, trust me. Okay?

54
00:03:04.351 --> 00:03:08.063
Look, I'm so sorry about all of this. I...

55
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.190
Everything is gonna be okay.

56
00:03:10.941 --> 00:03:12.442
I have to go.

57
00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.325
Man: Okay, back it up.

58
00:03:20.492 --> 00:03:21.535
[Truck beeping]

59
00:03:37.342 --> 00:03:38.844
Get down!

60
00:03:50.564 --> 00:03:51.982
Hey.

61
00:03:52.399 --> 00:03:55.485
You planning on keeping all those cameras
Wells used to spy on us?

62
00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:57.154
Kind of creepy, don't you think?

63
00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.699
First rule of mechanical engineering, dude.
Never waste good tech.

64
00:04:00.866 --> 00:04:02.325
[Chuckles]

65
00:04:02.492 --> 00:04:03.535
[Monitor beeping]

66
00:04:05.328 --> 00:04:07.622
- Central city gold reserve's under attack.
- Gold?

67
00:04:08.123 --> 00:04:10.000
That's the case Singh wants us on.

68
00:04:10.208 --> 00:04:11.293
I'll be right back.

69
00:04:24.181 --> 00:04:26.516
You picked a bad day for this, pal.

70
00:04:29.352 --> 00:04:30.353
[Groaning]

71
00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:55.045
What was that?

72
00:04:57.756 --> 00:05:01.384
Your eye movement is normal.
No signs of neurological damage.

73
00:05:01.843 --> 00:05:03.929
Think the thief might have been
a metahuman...

74
00:05:04.095 --> 00:05:06.765
- Who put the whammy on you or something?
- I don't know.

75
00:05:06.973 --> 00:05:10.060
When rainbow raider got in my head...

76
00:05:10.268 --> 00:05:13.313
All I felt was anger.

77
00:05:13.522 --> 00:05:16.900
But this was not that. This was...

78
00:05:17.108 --> 00:05:18.902
Just overwhelming fear.

79
00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:20.111
Cisco: Huh.

80
00:05:21.655 --> 00:05:24.825
Looks like when you went down,
the thief got disoriented too.

81
00:05:25.325 --> 00:05:27.702
Maybe we both got whammied.

82
00:05:28.245 --> 00:05:30.038
Then you know how it feels.

83
00:05:39.589 --> 00:05:40.674
Hi, Barry.

84
00:05:43.635 --> 00:05:46.012
Or should I say the flash?

85
00:05:59.568 --> 00:06:02.863
This is one of the few times
I would not wanna be Barry Allen.

86
00:06:03.071 --> 00:06:04.656
I wonder what he's gonna say.

87
00:06:04.906 --> 00:06:09.411
- We should absolutely not listen in.
- It's none of our business.

88
00:06:12.247 --> 00:06:16.209
- But the flash is our business.
- And Iris did just find out Barry's the flash.

89
00:06:16.418 --> 00:06:20.088
So by transitive property,
Barry and Iris are our business.

90
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:26.761
How did you find out?

91
00:06:29.389 --> 00:06:30.515
The flash...

92
00:06:30.765 --> 00:06:34.436
The other night, I
felt a jolt of electricity.

93
00:06:34.603 --> 00:06:38.273
The only other time I've felt anything
like that was when you were in a coma...

94
00:06:38.481 --> 00:06:40.692
After the accident.

95
00:06:41.818 --> 00:06:44.988
Heh. I can't believe
I didn't figure it out sooner.

96
00:06:45.196 --> 00:06:49.576
I can only imagine how angry you are.

97
00:06:49.784 --> 00:06:51.953
I'm not angry, Barry.

98
00:06:52.162 --> 00:06:54.247
I'm just disappointed.

99
00:06:55.457 --> 00:06:57.083
Okay.

100
00:06:57.959 --> 00:07:00.003
Does Eddie know?

101
00:07:03.298 --> 00:07:04.591
Yes, he does.

102
00:07:05.467 --> 00:07:06.968
Is that why he got kidnapped?

103
00:07:07.135 --> 00:07:09.846
No, I don't know why Wells took Eddie. I...

104
00:07:10.013 --> 00:07:12.182
Dr. Wells is the man in yellow?

105
00:07:13.516 --> 00:07:15.810
Everything he's been doing...

106
00:07:15.977 --> 00:07:17.687
Helping me...

107
00:07:17.896 --> 00:07:20.106
It was all a lie.

108
00:07:20.982 --> 00:07:23.985
Wells killed my mom.

109
00:07:27.739 --> 00:07:30.742
- Is he gonna kill Eddie?
- No, he's not. I'm gonna get Eddie back.

110
00:07:30.909 --> 00:07:32.786
- I swear.
- The flash said the same thing.

111
00:07:32.953 --> 00:07:36.748
Look, Iris, you have to believe me. There
were so many times I wanted to tell you.

112
00:07:36.915 --> 00:07:39.501
You were the first person I wanted to tell.

113
00:07:39.668 --> 00:07:43.254
But then everything started getting crazy.
And I thought maybe Joe was right...

114
00:07:43.505 --> 00:07:46.508
Wait, wait, wait.
You're telling me that my dad knew...

115
00:07:46.675 --> 00:07:48.927
And he told you not to tell me?

116
00:07:49.302 --> 00:07:51.221
He was trying to protect you.

117
00:07:51.429 --> 00:07:53.515
We both were.

118
00:07:55.433 --> 00:07:58.520
Yeah, well,
maybe it's time you both stopped.

119
00:08:05.902 --> 00:08:08.446
Yeah, if we could get another shipment...

120
00:08:08.655 --> 00:08:11.616
Of the computers in here.

121
00:08:11.825 --> 00:08:15.829
- I don't think that had anything to do with us.
- Nope.

122
00:08:27.632 --> 00:08:28.675
[Door opens]

123
00:08:32.220 --> 00:08:33.972
I don't suppose you brought lunch.

124
00:08:37.684 --> 00:08:40.812
Did you know that human beings...

125
00:08:41.062 --> 00:08:42.939
Can survive up to two months...

126
00:08:44.274 --> 00:08:45.358
Without food?

127
00:08:47.569 --> 00:08:50.572
Is that how long you're planning
on keeping me here?

128
00:08:50.864 --> 00:08:52.574
You know...

129
00:08:54.701 --> 00:08:56.995
I doubt it'll come to that.

130
00:08:59.914 --> 00:09:02.083
You wanna tell me
what we're doing down here?

131
00:09:07.380 --> 00:09:10.842
You told me we're related,
that you're from the future.

132
00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:15.889
- Prove it.
- Yeah, I don't have to prove anything...

133
00:09:16.097 --> 00:09:17.849
To anyone.

134
00:09:18.475 --> 00:09:21.978
Well, I think you're full of crap.
And whatever you're trying to do...

135
00:09:22.187 --> 00:09:24.939
You're not gonna get away with it
because the flash is...

136
00:09:26.858 --> 00:09:27.942
Stop talking.

137
00:09:49.881 --> 00:09:51.883
I heard you talked to Barry.

138
00:09:56.429 --> 00:10:01.643
So this is what
my cold-shoulder treatment feels like.

139
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.944
Baby, the way I went about things, maybe...

140
00:10:11.152 --> 00:10:13.363
No, I was wrong.

141
00:10:14.364 --> 00:10:16.825
I was just trying to keep you safe.

142
00:10:17.909 --> 00:10:19.994
You know, that excuse
is getting really old.

143
00:10:21.287 --> 00:10:25.667
First, it was the police academy,
and then it was dating Eddie, and now this.

144
00:10:25.834 --> 00:10:29.003
Sweetheart, you know
what the man in yellow is capable of.

145
00:10:29.212 --> 00:10:31.089
He killed cops. He killed Mason bridge.

146
00:10:32.841 --> 00:10:34.300
Wells killed Mason?

147
00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:38.179
- And you're covering that up?
- No.

148
00:10:38.388 --> 00:10:40.765
No. No, no, no.

149
00:10:41.057 --> 00:10:45.311
If the world finds out about Wells, they find
out about Barry. I'm trying to keep him safe.

150
00:10:45.478 --> 00:10:49.232
Did you ever stop to think
that looping me in would keep me safe?

151
00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:52.735
That if I knew what was going on out there,
I could prepare for it?

152
00:10:52.902 --> 00:10:57.031
Maybe I could've helped you and Barry put the
bad guys away instead of being in the way.

153
00:10:57.198 --> 00:10:59.033
I asked myself that question every day.

154
00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.329
- Every time you post something on your blog.
- It's not just about Barry being the flash.

155
00:11:03.538 --> 00:11:07.876
You knew how he felt about me for god knows
how long, and you didn't tell me that either.

156
00:11:08.084 --> 00:11:09.752
That wasn't for me to tell, Iris.

157
00:11:10.753 --> 00:11:15.216
You know what? If any of you had been honest
with me, maybe Eddie would still be here.

158
00:11:15.383 --> 00:11:18.553
He wouldn't have gotten involved in this
if I hadn't been dating him.

159
00:11:18.761 --> 00:11:21.222
Are you saying
if you had known how Barry felt...?

160
00:11:21.431 --> 00:11:24.726
What I am saying is that
what happened to Eddie is your fault.

161
00:11:25.894 --> 00:11:26.936
[Phone buzzing]

162
00:11:28.313 --> 00:11:29.647
This is work.

163
00:11:30.732 --> 00:11:32.108
We can finish this talk.

164
00:11:33.401 --> 00:11:35.153
Talking.

165
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:37.238
Yeah, that'll be new.

166
00:11:45.538 --> 00:11:47.373
Yeah, boss.

167
00:11:52.003 --> 00:11:53.755
Barry:
I just got a call from Joe.

168
00:11:53.922 --> 00:11:57.675
The central city gold reserve is about
to transport $300 million in gold bars...

169
00:11:57.884 --> 00:11:59.260
To their coast city vault.

170
00:11:59.427 --> 00:12:02.430
Singh told Joe they think the man in
the mask is gonna make a play for it.

171
00:12:02.639 --> 00:12:06.935

were working on a project...

232
00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:40.541

to create soldiers with psychic abilities.

with telepathic and telekinetic capabilities.

When Wells found out about the
terrible experiments eiling was doing...

236

I went down to check on him...

And his cage was empty.

242
00:17:05.358 --> 00:17:08.736
So he could've been affected
by the same energy that hit Barry.

When the dark matter hit grodd...

244
00:17:10.821 --> 00:17:15.493
All the drugs and serums that eiling
injected him with could've activated.

245
00:17:15.701 --> 00:17:19.288
Maybe the accelerator explosion
created a meta-gorilla.

His brain is lit up in the exact same way.

254

are connected somehow.

- Grodd and Wells did have a special bond.

It's the same thing we saw in eiling.

345
00:24:48.904 --> 00:24:52.825
The images you saw
were some kind of psychic attack by grodd.

We're gonna save both of them.
I promise you.

348
00:24:59.873 --> 00:25:03.585
I put a tracker in the tranq dart you
shot grodd with. As soon as it activates...

349

I can't wait for that. I will search
every inch of that sewer if I have to.

What happens if grodd takes over your mind
the same way he did with eiling?

Can you guys build me something?

Why did he insist
on going down there with you?

365
00:25:54.678 --> 00:25:56.430
He's always preaching about being safe...

366

But not once does he think about
running into danger himself.

- No, Barry. He's just a regular cop.

not to tell you that I was the flash...

00:36:49.666 --> 00:36:52.752
Dad, I was so afraid that
something would happen to you.

515
00:36:53.253 --> 00:36:56.840
My life started when you were born.

516
00:36:57.006 --> 00:36:59.175
And sometimes...

517
00:36:59.342 --> 00:37:05.348
My incredible love for you,
it blinds me, and I forget...

518
00:37:05.557 --> 00:37:10.353
I forget what a brilliant
young woman you are.

519
00:37:11.354 --> 00:37:14.566
How you're capable
of making your own decisions.

520
00:37:17.402 --> 00:37:22.323
Daddy, I know that everything that you do
is out of love.

521
00:37:22.532 --> 00:37:26.077
So love me enough
to always tell me the truth.

522
00:37:26.327 --> 00:37:27.912
- Yeah?
- Deal. Deal.

523
00:37:28.163 --> 00:37:29.789
Okay.

524
00:37:31.207 --> 00:37:32.208
Joe: Ow.

525
00:37:32.375 --> 00:37:34.377
Oh, my bad.

526
00:37:34.586 --> 00:37:36.921
Oh, my bad. Oh, my god.

527
00:37:37.172 --> 00:37:39.382
Caitlin: Maybe it's a good thing
we didn't catch grodd.

528
00:37:39.883 --> 00:37:40.884
Where would we put him?

529
00:37:41.092 --> 00:37:46.181
I mean, the pipeline isn't exactly equipped to
hold a super-intelligent, telepathic gorilla.

530
00:37:47.098 --> 00:37:50.935
Joe mentioned that
grodd called Wells, "father."

531
00:37:51.561 --> 00:37:54.355
Wells must've ordered grodd
to come after us.

532
00:37:54.564 --> 00:37:57.734
It's why grodd didn't kill Joe.

533
00:37:58.109 --> 00:38:03.865
I think Joe was right. Everything
grodd did, it was just to distract us.

534
00:38:05.825 --> 00:38:07.243
What's going on? You okay?

535
00:38:07.452 --> 00:38:10.079
Just thinking about this headset.

536
00:38:10.622 --> 00:38:12.916
It wasn't strong enough.

537
00:38:16.085 --> 00:38:17.921
You could've been killed out there, man.

538
00:38:18.129 --> 00:38:20.131
No, dude, your tech worked.

539
00:38:20.381 --> 00:38:22.926
And it proved that we don't need Wells.

540
00:38:23.134 --> 00:38:26.554
The three of us took on grodd
and rescued Joe.

541
00:38:27.597 --> 00:38:30.058
Together, we can do anything.

542
00:38:31.351 --> 00:38:35.230
Actually, it was the four of us.

543
00:38:52.455 --> 00:38:53.915
Barry: Hey.

544
00:38:54.666 --> 00:38:55.750
Hey.

545
00:38:57.252 --> 00:38:58.753
How did you know I was here?

546
00:38:58.962 --> 00:39:01.965
This is your spot.

547
00:39:04.133 --> 00:39:05.885
Yeah, it's a special spot.

548
00:39:06.594 --> 00:39:09.389
It's where I first met the flash.

549
00:39:10.139 --> 00:39:14.811
All those times, you were standing
right in front of me and I had no idea.

550
00:39:17.146 --> 00:39:19.315
I don't even know you anymore.

551
00:39:21.442 --> 00:39:24.153
Iris, what you were saying to me...

552
00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.823
When I was down in the sewer...

553
00:39:28.157 --> 00:39:30.952
You know why I wasn't afraid?

554
00:39:31.327 --> 00:39:33.454
Because you were there.

555
00:39:34.497 --> 00:39:38.418
Even though I really was scared,
having you there...

556
00:39:38.626 --> 00:39:41.921
Is how I could stand up to grodd.

557
00:39:42.130 --> 00:39:45.174
Every time I falter...

558
00:39:45.425 --> 00:39:48.219
Or make a mistake...

559
00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:52.849
The thought of you is what picks me up
and keeps me going.

560
00:39:54.183 --> 00:39:56.185
Look, what I'm trying to say is...

561
00:39:56.352 --> 00:40:00.523
Even though you
didn't know everything...

562
00:40:00.732 --> 00:40:02.734
About my life this past year...

563
00:40:02.984 --> 00:40:06.446
That does not mean
that you weren't a part of it.

564
00:40:07.447 --> 00:40:09.198
You were.

565
00:40:09.949 --> 00:40:13.202
Every single day.

566
00:40:14.370 --> 00:40:16.497
Without you...

567
00:40:17.373 --> 00:40:19.876
There wouldn't be the flash.

568
00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:25.048
I've thought about what you said...

569
00:40:25.381 --> 00:40:27.675
And maybe you were right.

570
00:40:28.468 --> 00:40:30.720
I have been thinking about you...

571
00:40:31.262 --> 00:40:32.889
. "About us".

572
00:40:34.057 --> 00:40:36.225
But I can't do that anymore.

573
00:40:36.851 --> 00:40:39.979
Eddie is the man that I live with,
the man that I love...

574
00:40:40.188 --> 00:40:41.522
And he's still missing.

575
00:40:41.898 --> 00:40:43.399
I know.

576
00:40:43.608 --> 00:40:46.069
I'm gonna bring him back.

577
00:40:50.490 --> 00:40:52.033
And after that?

578
00:40:54.077 --> 00:40:55.912
I don't know.

579
00:40:57.246 --> 00:40:59.290
I don't know.

580
00:41:05.755 --> 00:41:06.756
[Grodd growling]

581
00:41:21.104 --> 00:41:23.690
- Eddie: So now what?
- Now...

582
00:41:26.275 --> 00:41:27.694
I have the key.

583
00:41:30.029 --> 00:41:32.365
The key to what?

584
00:41:55.054 --> 00:41:57.348
Time to go home.

585
00:42:26.669 --> 00:42:28.671
